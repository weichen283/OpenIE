Then we pipet at t = 0 s , 100 microliters diluted plasma + 100 microliters reagent 1 in a reaction tube ; at t = 30 s , 100 microliters reagent 2 in the same tube and at t = 90 s , 200 microliters of the reaction mixture in a cuvette with 700 microliters EDTA buffer ( stop buffer ) and the formed factor Xa is measured with a chromogenic substrate .
