Inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump by CD44 receptor activation of tyrosine kinases increases the action potential afterhyperpolarization in sensory neurons .
STIM1 knock-down inhibited ER Ca ( 2+ ) uptake in intact but not in permeabilized cells , suggesting a privileged calcium entry - calcium refilling ( CECR ) coupling between plasma membrane SOC and ER calcium pump in the intact cell .
Furthermore , the recent successful and safe completion of a phase 2 trial targeting the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca ( 2+ ) ATPase pump along with the start of more recent phase 1 trials are ushering in a new era of gene therapy for the treatment of heart failure .
