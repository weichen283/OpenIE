Pseudomonas aeruginosa elaborates several pigment fractions that fluoresce in ultraviolet light .
From premetaphase to telophase the meiotic chromosomes fluoresce strongly again .
They also fluoresce in the wavelength range 650-800 nm .
One useful photophysical property is the ability to fluoresce with high quantum yields .
Insulin fibrils converted to a beta-sheet conformation fluoresce intensely with ThT .
These dyes are excited to fluoresce by microscope illumination of the appropriate wavelength .
Normally , the entity does not fluoresce .
Oocytes not exposed to the labeled cholesterol did not fluoresce .
Reactive and normal bone did not fluoresce .
In tumor , malignant cells do not fluoresce and connective tissue cells fluoresce brilliantly .
Results indicated that resin brands fluoresce at different wavelengths and with varying intensities .
Early reticulocytes did not fluoresce , but more mature reticulocytes showed increased fluorescent intensity .
Some AGEs fluoresce and can be measured noninvasively by optical spectroscopy .
Nuclei also fluoresce but their nucleoli do not .
Lanthanide based coordination polymers chill , relax under magnetic field and also fluoresce .
Their ability to fluoresce and visualize the lesion is a bonus .
Many anthraquinone related compounds are highly coloured and fluoresce .
These QDs have diameters of 3-6 nm and fluoresce around 1050 nm .
These absorb in the range 465-470 nm and fluoresce at approx .
All the analytes except paracetamol absorb and fluoresce in the visible region .
The starch granules fluoresce greenish yellow , allowing the degradative state to be observed .
They may fluoresce up to 30 seconds after the anterior ciliary arteries .
The extracellular pigment deposits fluoresce red-yellow .
Tissue lipids then fluoresce yellow-gold to red , depending on their relative hydrophobicity .
