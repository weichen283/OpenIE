To determine the conductance of a molecule , one must wire the molecule reliably to at least two electrodes .
After positioning a guiding catheter in the LCX ostium , we wanted to protect the LAD , but we could not wire both arteries because of separation between the two ostia .
Because the hydrogels envelope the redox enzymes , they electrically wire the reaction centers to electrodes irrespective of spatial orientation and connect to electrode redox centers of multiple enzyme layers .
Various strategies to immobilize the photosynthetic complexes on conductive surfaces and different methodologies to electrically wire them with the electrode supports are presented .
The fractured traction wire and basket could be safely removed by pulling the traction wire from the mouth .
The performance of the groups ^indicated that persistent abusers wire the poorest and that abstinence were followed by welcome change in memory .
Endocrine cells in the mammalian pituitary are arranged into three-dimensional homotypic networks that wire the gland and act to optimise hormone output by allowing the transmission of information between cell ensembles in a temporally precise manner .
