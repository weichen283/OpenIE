Interestingly , Nedd4 is also able to ubiquitinate GGA3 .
Here , we found that Parkin can interact with and ubiquitinate mTOR .
Charged E2s function with E3s to ubiquitinate substrates .
SHARPIN - containing complexes can linearly ubiquitinate NEMO and activated NF-kappaB .
We speculate that SopA ubiquitinate bacterial/host proteins involved in Salmonella-induced intestinal inflammation .
Furthermore , Nedd4-2 could ubiquitinate KCNQ2/3 in transfected cells .
Ubiquitin ligases recognize and ubiquitinate target proteins for subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome .
To ubiquitinate or to deubiquitinate : it all depends on the partners .
Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases ubiquitinate protein substrates and control their levels through degradation .
CRLs ubiquitinate substrate proteins and thus target them for proteasomal degradation .
Smurf1 also enhances Rac1 activation but it does not ubiquitinate Rac1 .
Thus Nedd4-2 does not ubiquitinate and thereby regulate wt-CFTR in human airway epithelial cells .
They are ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate and target many signaling molecules for degradation .
Cbl proteins are ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate and target many signaling molecules for degradation .
Interestingly , UbcH6 could ubiquitinate ataxin-1 in the absence of an E3 ligase .
Like most E3 ligases , Mdm2 can also ubiquitinate itself .
AIP4 is found to bind and ubiquitinate Amot130 at residue Lys - 481 .
