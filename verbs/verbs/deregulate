Multiple pathogenic pathways are able to deregulate glucose homoeostasis leading to diabetes .
Thus mutations by themselves are insufficient to deregulate c-myc transcription .
Somatic mutation has been shown to deregulate the RhoGAP activity of DLC1 .
Recent studies have begun to explain how oncogenic events may deregulate the hemostatic system .
Stress granule-defective mutants deregulate stress responsive transcripts .
However , we found CDK3 to deregulate E2F - dependent transcription .
HnRNP proteins controlled by c-Myc deregulate pyruvate kinase mRNA splicing in cancer .
Oncogenic ETS fusions deregulate E2F3 target genes in Ewing sarcoma and prostate cancer .
Human tropomyosin mutations deregulate skeletal muscle contraction at the cellular level .
TRNA mutations that affect decoding fidelity deregulate development and the proteostasis network in zebrafish .
In addition E7 proteins deregulate the cell cycle and enhance invasive growth .
