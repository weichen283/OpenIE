If the climate continues to warm as predicted , we predict that the polar bear population in the northern Beaufort Sea will eventually decline .
As climate continues to warm and sea ice declines , similar changes will likely be repeated in other coastal areas of the circumpolar Arctic .
In general , the arctic freshwater-terrestrial system will warm more rapidly than the global average , particularly during the autumn and winter season .
US-Malagasy relations have been warm for most of its history until 1971 when the US ambassador and 5 members of his staff were expelled .
In Experiment 1 , the ambient temperature either remained warm during both the light and dark phases of the photoperiod , as is characteristic in laboratory settings , or was warm during the light phase and cold during the dark phase .
A four-part experiment was undertaken to determine the feasibility of adding normal saline warmed to 45 C to units of packed red blood cells ( PRBCs ) to warm them and increase blood flow in transfusions .
This can be adequately done by using a combined heat-exchanger and scrubber where the heat produced by CO2 absorption is used to warm the inspired gas .
The employment of microwave techniques permits to warm the investigated brain zone and to record the temperature decrease extracranially .
In a second series of experiments , bar-pressing would warm the water flowing in the thermode .
On the other hand , a minority of teams can actively warm patients , employ tranexamic acid or use pelvic restraint belts .
Our data demonstrate the potential energetic benefits of warming up muscle before activity , which is seen in diverse groups of animals such as bees , which warm flight muscle before take-off , and humans performing warm ups before exercise .
