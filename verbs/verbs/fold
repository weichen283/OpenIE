Many members of the LuxR family of acyl-homoserine lactone ( acyl-HSL ) -dependent quorum-sensing transcriptional activators are thought to have the unusual characteristics of requiring the signal ligand during polypeptide synthesis to fold into an active conformation and of binding signal extraordinarily tightly .
We present evidence that LasR can fold into an active conformation in vivo in the absence of the acyl-HSL ligand .
We then select a subset of 1501 conformations that have equal probabilities to fold and to unfold as the set of TSE .
From exponentially large numbers of possible sequences , protein design seeks to identify the properties of those that fold to predetermined structures and have targeted structural and functional properties .
It is commonly recognized that proteins must fold into a native structure with preference over an unfolded state , and must bind to functional interacting partners favourably to function properly .
To optimize the in vivo folding of proteins , we linked protein stability to antibiotic resistance , thereby forcing bacteria to effectively fold and stabilize proteins .
The polypeptide fold and the catalytic residues of StPrpC are conserved in citrate synthases ( CSs ) suggesting similarities in their functional mechanisms .
