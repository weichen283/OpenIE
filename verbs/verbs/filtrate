The HEPA filter could filtrate 99.99 % simulating viruses in the air .
Furthermore , as we did not filtrate the drugs before filling , we speculate that ampule fragments could have provoked the rupture .
According to the given contextual restrictions , 2L-SEM can filtrate the illegal and invalid mobile codes contained in tags .
It is suggested that the percolate did not filtrate downwards evenly , part of percolate filtrates downwards along stems , roots and cracks existing in dried sludge which have lower flow resistance .
Then , blue-white selection and T7/SP6 PCR was used to screen the positive clones , the target DNA and the express vector pRNAT-U6.2 were cut down by BamHI and XhoI restriction enzyme , and linked with each other ; use PCR test to filtrate the positive clones and sequenced the target DNA , then transfected it into human small lung cancer cell line ( NCI-H446 ) , cultured and screened by G418 , RT-PCR was used to detect the expression level of AKT2 mRNA in NCI-H446 .
