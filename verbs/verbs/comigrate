By contrast , all three comigrate with casein kinase activity .
The 83- , 72- , and 69-kdalton proteins comigrate in all species examined .
The predominant product of 16-17 kDa frequently appears to comigrate with TMV coat protein .
NikA was found to comigrate with both hemin and protoporphyrin IX during gel filtration .
This allowed the anions to comigrate with the EOF and yielded a rapid separation .
