The somatic embryos in various shapes and sizes after the first subculture on MS medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/l IAA and 0.25 mg/l BA ; developed shoots and rooted in 1/2 strength MS medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/l IBA or IAA .
However , maintaining alpha-particle-irradiated cells in the confluent state for various times prior to subculture resulted in increased rather than decreased lethality and was associated with persistent DNA damage and increased protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation .
After subculture and expansion , the human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells infected with Ad - GFP or liposome were observed and analyzed with fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry to assess transfection efficiency .
Factors which influence the results include the bacterial taxa involved , their site of origin and the methods and media used to isolate and subculture the bacteria , and to perform the sensitivity tests .
The PFGE profiles of the STEC strains changed by 1 to 8 fragments after repeated subculture and prolonged storage ; one strain was no longer clonal after repeated subculture compared to the original isolate according to the Tenover criteria .
