Use of these methods will allow for better utilization of parental plants when both parents do not flower on the same days .
The mutation could not normally flower and produce bolls under natural conditions , and its mature height was only 10.5 cm .
When treated with exogenous GA3 , it could normally flower and boll , and plant height could reach 57.8 cm finally .
Some plant species are constrained to co-occur , for example parasitic plants and their hosts , and may overlap in their pollination niche if they flower at the same time and attract the same pollinators .
At present , there are results of only 6 spaceflight experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana , an ephemeral plant which will flower and fruit in orbit .
