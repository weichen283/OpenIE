5-aza-2-deoxycytidine was used to demethylate the RASSF1A promoter in cell lines .
Cells were then treated to specifically demethylate these proteins .
Quercetin is able to demethylate the p16INK4a gene promoter .
Both species demethylate the unchanged drug more readily than subsequent metabolites .
Although histone methyltransferases are known , enzymes that demethylate histones have not been identified .
But their specific activity is low and the other cytochrome P-450 species demethylate NDMA .
In contrast , TSA treatment failed to demethylate or activate the GSTP1 gene .
In our hands , MBD2 does not demethylate DNA .
These enzymes demethylate lysine residues in histones in a methylation-state and sequence-specific context .
Treatment of HepG2 with 5-aza-deoxycytidine could demethylate the promoter and increase ZHX2 mRNA expression .
Nasal microsomes can demethylate both NDMA and NTDMA but the kinetics are vastly different .
They also demethylate p- and m-anisate and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamate , but to a lower degree .
Lysine-specific demethylase 1 ( LSD1 ) and LSD2 demethylate H3K4me2/1 .
Human enteric microsomal CYP4F enzymes O - demethylate the antiparasitic prodrug pafuramidine .
CoM could demethylate , and DMS and MMPA could remethylate , the corrinoid cofactor .
