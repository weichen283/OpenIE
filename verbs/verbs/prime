Clinical trials using aAPC-expanded or -activated NK cells are underway , one using leukemic cell line CTV-1 to prime and activate NK cells without significant expansion .
Studies so far have shown that the treatment of dendritic cells ( DCs ) with a TLR3 ligand , polyinosinic-polycytidylicacid [ Poly ( I : C ) ] , may be an appropriate activation agent for obtaining mature MoDCs , competent to prime effective immune responses .
Exposure to these antigens by means of a TST may prime an immune response that leads to a false-positive result in a subsequent IGRA , limiting the validity of IGRAs in patients in whom these tests are performed sequentially .
To evaluate the effects exerted by the chondrocytic culture condition on AMSC , we utilized chondrocyte conditioned medium ( CM ) and/or co-culture methods to prime and differentiate AMSCs .
Arousal-related inputs are known to prime amygdaloid mechanisms for fear and anxiety , with resultant social avoidance .
Stable incorporation of SF-1 into embryonic stem cells ( SF-1 - ES cells ) has been shown to prime the cells for steroidogenesis .
The RRV-LV could also be used to infect human mDC and to prime a human T cell immune response .
