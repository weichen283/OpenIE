Storm events can pulse nutrients and carbon from soils and provide an important subsidy to food webs in oligotrophic streams and lakes .
Using electroosmosis to drive flow through microfluidic channels , we pulse minute quantities of a bradykinin solution through four 5-microm apertures onto PC12 cells and show stimulation of individual cells using a Ca ( 2+ ) -sensitive fluorescent dye .
