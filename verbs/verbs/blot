SLE sera could blot a few bands .
The monoclonal antibodies that can blot the IgA binding sites of Fc alpha R could only bind to the membrane-distal domains of Fc alpha R ( EC1 ) .
pabBp19 did not blot human platelet lysates but human pp - vWF was detectable using the antibody Frieda 013091 .
All nine affinity-purified anti-DNA antibodies could blot the HMC membrane proteins , and there were at least three bands at 74 kDa , 63 kDa and 42 kDa that could be blotted .
Positive sera could blot the 27-kD band by Western blot analysis .
