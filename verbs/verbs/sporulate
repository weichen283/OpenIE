The homozygous diploid mutant fails to sporulate at the nonpermissive temperature .
All of the mutants are induced to sporulate by glycerol .
Transformants were selected for their ability to grow and sporulate on medium lacking uracil .
Few isolates sporulate at high levels in this medium .
M. fulvum did not sporulate at higher concentration of griseofulvin .
Mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe which sporulate in the haploid state .

Oocysts did not sporulate in vitro .
Mutants lacking AcbA sporulate well only when developed in chimeras with WT cells .
A revertant of this mutant regained the ability to both sporulate and synthesize pppAppp .
The oomycete has spiny oogonia and does not sporulate readily .
Cultures maintained on yeast extract-starch medium retained the ability to sporulate and utilize glycerol .
The diploid hybrids from crosses between these species sporulate well but are essentially infertile .
mum3 mutants sporulate poorly and the spores produced are inviable .
Such strains sporulate but germination is poor and only one-spore tetrads are formed .
Homozygous diploid mai1Delta cells sporulate , but with a slightly reduced frequency .
Such strains conjugate and sporulate less frequently than wild-type cells upon nutrient limitation .
