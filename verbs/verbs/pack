The bio-based films were used to pack palm oil ( maintained for 45 days of storage ) under accelerated oxidation conditions ( 63 % relative humidity and 30 degreesC ) to simulate a storage experiment .
Participants were then asked to identify which pack in the array they would choose if they were concerned with health , tar , nicotine , image , and taste .
Dimeric E proteins pack their fusion loops into analogous pockets at the dimer interface .
From the change of the ratio of gas permeability for the membrane with modifications , it is suggested that approximately 100 nm sized rice husk silica particles pack the large pores among the micron sized rice husk silica particles while the chemical deposition of tetraethylorthosilicate ( TEOS ) reveals the gas flow through 4 nm pores in the rice husk silica by blocking large pores .
The molecules pack tail to tail in a bilayer structure .
