This allows us to ramp arbitrary diffusion rate profiles during the self-assembly process of macromolecules , such as collagen .
With our modular hardware design , we successfully ramp the 0.4-T polarizing coil of a wrist-sized PMRI scanner at up to 100 T/s without causing image artifacts or otherwise degrading data acquisition .
