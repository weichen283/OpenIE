Impact of screw elements on continuous granulation with a twin - screw extruder .
The 4 extrusion treatments included the following : 1 ) FP0 , ground , nonextruded ; 2 ) FP1 , single-screw extruded ; 3 ) FP2 , twin - screw extruded with low intensity ( screw speed 120 rpm ; die temperature 110 degrees C ; water input 5 kg/h ) ; and 4 ) FP3 , twin - screw extruded with high intensity ( 300 rpm ; 125 degrees C ; 11 kg/h ) .
Comparison of two twin - screw extruders for continuous granulation .
