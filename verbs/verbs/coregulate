IHH and FGF8 coregulate elongation of digit primordia .
Adenosine and dopamine receptors coregulate photoreceptor coupling via gap junction phosphorylation in mouse retina .
The second network consists of miR-TF pairs that coregulate large sets of common targets .
Meis1 and Prep1 nonetheless coregulate a subset of genes , predominantly through opposing effects .
Akt and CHIP coregulate tau degradation through coordinated interactions .
Indian hedgehog and syndecans-3 coregulate chondrocyte proliferation and function during chick limb skeletogenesis .
We addressed whether these miRNAs have functional targets beyond RUNX2 that coregulate skeletal development .
What factors regulate and coregulate the periosteal and endocortical modeling and remodeling ?
We therefore hypothesize that the siderophore and ferritin coregulate cellular iron metabolism/homeostasis in eukaryotes .
