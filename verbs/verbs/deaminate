During hyperoxia monoamine oxidase type A acquires the ability to deaminate polyamines and histamine .
All tissues were found to preferentially deaminate deoxyadenosine .
In contrast we confirmed that the primary function of GDH is to deaminate Glu .
Nonetheless , cells grown in the presence of glycine will reductively deaminate it .
[Ability of yeast-like fungi to deaminate 5-fluorocytosine ] .
Members of the AID / APOBEC protein family can deaminate DNA .
The Deltauga1 strain cannot deaminate GABA to succinate semialdehyde .
The ADAR RNA-editing enzymes deaminate adenosine bases to inosines in cellular RNAs .
Thus , APOBEC1 can deaminate cytosine in both RNA and DNA .
This deaminates cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA but does not deaminate 5-methyl cytosine .
It was shown here that these enzymes actually deaminate 6-aminodeoxyfutalosine .
