sentence: Inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump by CD44 receptor activation of tyrosine kinases increases the action potential afterhyperpolarization in sensory neurons . STIM1 knock-down inhibited ER Ca ( 2+ ) uptake in intact but not in permeabilized cells , suggesting a privileged calcium entry-calcium refilling ( CECR ) coupling between plasma membrane SOC and ER calcium pump in the intact cell .
