sentence: It has been shown that eubacterial and eukaryotic TrpRSs can not efficiently cross-aminoacylate the corresponding tRNA ( Trp ) . During the early phases of thrombus formation , activated factor XIII ( FXIIIa ) covalently cross-links alpha ( 2 ) -antiplasmin to fibrin , indicating the potential of alpha ( 2 ) -antiplasmin-based CAs in the detection of early thrombus formation .
