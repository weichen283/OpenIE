sentence: We genotype these and 42 other top CT hepatic steatosis-associated SNPs in 592 subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD from the NASH Clinical Research Network ( NASH CRN ) . We genotype S-RNase alleles from Mauritian endemic Coffea , and using S-allele gene genealogies , we show that the Mauritian allelic diversity is confined to just seven deeply divergent Coffea S-RNase allelic lineages .
