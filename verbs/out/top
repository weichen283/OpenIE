sentence: Calves received ad libitum amounts of corn silage top-dressed with the respective supplement ( .81 kg/head ) . Treatments included 1 ) a roughage-based diet fed at 2.75 % of BW , 2 ) a corn-based diet fed at 1.5 % of BW , 3 ) a corn-based diet fed at 2.25 % of BW , 4 ) a soybean hull-based diet fed at 1.5 % of BW ( SH1.5 ) , 5 ) a soybean hull-based diet fed at 2.25 % of BW ( SH2.25 ) , 6 ) SH1.5 top-dressed with 11.4 g/d Alimet ( 10 g/d MHA ) , 7 ) SH2.25 top-dressed with 11.4 g/d Alimet , 8 ) SH2.25 top-dressed with 7 g/d of a lipid-coated betaine product ( 4.2 g/d betaine ) , and 9 ) SH2.25 top-dressed with 250 g/d CSB ( 15.5 g/d betaine ) . These results suggest that feeding POMx top-dressed onto the grain suppresses intake of grain and digestibility of fat and protein , likely because of the high tannin content .
