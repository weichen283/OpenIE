sentence: Whereas in period I 17 % of children younger than 1 year were discharged home after transplant or weaning , rate during period II was 93 % ( P < .001 ) , in particular because of improvement in discharge rate of patients with postcardiotomy heart failure ( 13 % vs 50 % ) . In conclusion , kidney transplant from a living donor is a natural choice within the pediatric setting .
