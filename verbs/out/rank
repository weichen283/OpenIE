sentence: The motivation for this approach is twofold ; first , the final results of microarray studies are typically expressed as lists of genes , rank-ordered by a measure of the strength of evidence that they are functionally involved in the disease process , and second , using the information on this rank-ordered metric means that we do not have to concern ourselves with data on the actual expression levels , which may not be comparable across experiments .
