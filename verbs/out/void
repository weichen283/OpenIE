sentence: After caffeine ingestion , the mean volume at bladder filling phase decreased at first desire to void and normal desire to void ( P<0.05 ) , compared to the mean volume after taking water ( control ) drink . Success was defined as follows : when TUS placement allowed patients to void spontaneously and/or when surgery was made feasible after the period of relative contraindication ( therapeutic group ) or when TUS placement allowed physicians to define the role of prostate obstruction in the patients ' voiding disorders and therefore to make an appropriate therapeutic decision ( diagnosis group ) . The mean volume at strong desire to void , urgency and maximum cystometric capacity also tended to decrease .
