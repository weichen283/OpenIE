sentence: The main reason for decreasing the yields of HAAs as shown by scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) is that Fe ( OH ) ( 3 ( am ) ) or MnO ( 2 ( am ) ) coat the algal cells , which then improves their agglomeration of algal cells which is also revealed by the laser particle size analysis ( LPSA ) .
