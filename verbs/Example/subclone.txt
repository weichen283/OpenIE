obj#conj	The plasmid pE194 as a vector is used to subclone the thermostable alpha-amylase gene of B. licheniformis and construct recombinant plasmid pNW102 .	obj@gene conj_and@construct
obj#conj	Here , we describe how to subclone the gene coding for a cargo of interest into a RUSH plasmid and to monitor its synchronized transport along the secretory pathway in fixed samples and in living cells .	obj@gene conj_and@monitor
