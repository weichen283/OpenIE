subj#prep	Since the structural properties of the mesophase systems are a key factor in drug release applications , we investigated the effects of these guest molecules on their conformations and the way these molecules partition within the domains of the mesophases .	subj@molecules prep_within@domains
subj#prep	Although infectivity in human blood may not partition in the manner in which it is distributed in rodents , prion-reduction filters remove the residual plasma infectivity in rodent models .	subj@infectivity prep_in@manner

obj	Partial correlation analyses were used to partition the importance of every optically-active substance on UVR and PAR attenuation in the two different regions .	obj@importance
obj	The results obtained for variation in actual relationship apply directly to the variation in actual inbreeding as both are functions of genomic coancestry , and we show how to partition the variation in actual inbreeding between and within families .	obj@variation

subj#obj#prep	These breakpoints partition the genomic alignment into phylogenetically homogeneous loci , where sites within a given locus all share the same phylogenetic tree topology .	subj@breakpoints obj@alignment prep_into@loci
subj#obj#prep	With an adaptive partition procedure , we can partition a " time course " into consecutive non-overlapped intervals such that the population means/proportions of the observations in two adjacent intervals are significantly different at a given level .	subj@we obj@" prep_into@intervals prep_with@procedure

subj#prep#conj	We show that in general , scorpion beta-toxins do not partition in neuronal membranes and that in the case in which a depressant beta-toxin partitions in insect neuronal membranes , this partitioning is unrelated to its interaction with the receptor site and the effect on the gating properties of the sodium channel .	subj@beta-toxins prep_in@general prep_in@membranes conj_and@unrelated

obj#prep#conj	We have designed and carried out a microarray experiment to examine transcript variation across samples from adipose , heart , kidney , and liver tissues of C57BL/6J mice and to partition variation into within-mouse and between-mouse components .	obj@variation prep_into@components conj_and@examine
obj#prep#conj	We used multilevel Bayesian occupancy modeling to handle dependence structures and to partition sources of variation in occupancy of sites by terrestrial salamanders ( family Plethodontidae ) within and surrounding an earlier wildfire in western Oregon , USA .	obj@sources prep_within@and conj_and@handle
