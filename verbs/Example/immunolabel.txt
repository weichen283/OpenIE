prep	Our previous study , utilizing anti-Uca beta-PDH polyclonal antibody ( pAb ) to immunolabel the optic lobe of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus , suggested the existence of an alternative PDF-like peptide in the outer cells of the first neuropile , or lamina ( La ) , which were much less immunoreactive than the inner cells of the second neuropile , the medulla ( Me ) .	prep_to@antibody

obj#prep	Triple-immunofluorescence experiments with antibodies to cytochrome c oxidase , tubulin , and vimentin have been used to immunolabel the mitochondria , microtubules , and intermediate filaments inside the same cultured fibroblasts .	obj@mitochondria prep_inside@fibroblasts
obj#prep	The neurons did not immunolabel with NF-H or MAP2 , which might suggest they had not reached the level of maturity of other neurons in culture .	obj@did prep_with@NF-H

prep#conj	The major advantages of our method are ( i ) the possibility to correlate several hundreds of events at the same time , ( ii ) the possibility to perform three-dimensional ( 3D ) correlation , ( iii ) the possibility to immunolabel both endogenous and recombinantly expressed proteins at the same time and ( iv ) the possibility to combine the high data analysis capability of FLM with the high precision-accuracy of transmission electron microscopy in a CLEM hybrid morphometry analysis .	prep_to@possibility conj@proteins
