subj#obj#conj	The MICROCARD study will phenotype MMD and will investigate its relation with the incidence of MACE in ESRD patients with myocardial ischaemia .	subj@study obj@MMD conj_and@investigate

subj#obj#rel	In this study we characterize the coordination between the direction a fruit-fly walks and the direction it faces , as well as offer a methodology for isolating and validating key variables with which we phenotype fly locomotor behavior .	subj@we obj@behavior rel@which

prep#rel	We described herein their histological characteristics , discussed diagnostic problems in various instants in which each phenotype on this setting , and reviewed the literature , especially as to carcinosarcoma in contrast with those derived from other organs .	prep_on@setting rel@which
prep#rel	The comeasurement of the O - demethylation and N - demethylation of codeine may provide a tool with which to phenotype individuals in vitro with respect to the polymorphism of the cytochrome P-450IID1 .	prep_with_respect_to@polymorphism rel@which

obj#rel	Although the N - demethylation of erythromycin has found widespread use in a noninvasive assay with which to phenotype hepatic CYP3A function , currently , the routine in vitro analysis of erythromycin N-demethylase activity relies on the quantitation of liberated formaldehyde by relatively labor-intensive and insensitive colorimetric or fluorimetric detection .	obj@function rel@which
