conj	Transcriptional units were constructed consisting of a steroid - inducible mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) promoter , mouse or human 5 ' c-fos gene fragments in either the sense ( 5 ' to 3 ' ) or antisense ( 3 ' to 5 ' ) orientation , and splice and poly ( A ) signals from the human beta-globin gene .	conj_and@poly

prep#conj	Strikingly , ~15 % of upregulated genes are induced in association with derepression of promoter-proximal ERVs , half in the context of " chimeric " transcripts that initiate within these retroelements and splice to genic exons .	prep_to@exons conj_and@initiate

obj#prep	Int-n and Int-c fragments in the separate precursors catalyze , in concert , a protein trans-splicing process to splice the flanking DnaE-n and DnaE-c into a functional catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase III .	obj@DnaE-n prep_into@subunit
obj#prep	The alterations at the 3 ' end are caused by an aberrant splicing event in which additional splice-donor and -acceptor sequences within intronic sequences are used to splice an additional 363 nucleotides into the myb transcripts .	obj@nucleotides prep_into@transcripts

obj#conj	Moreover , the SmN mRNA shows a widespread distribution within the brain and spinal ganglia being present in neuronal cells in all regions which naturally produce CGRP as well as in those areas which do not naturally express the calcitonin / CGRP gene but which can correctly splice the CGRP mRNA in transgenic mice expressing the calcitonin / CGRP gene in all cell types .	obj@mRNA conj_but@express
