prep	At the beginning of postnuptial molt ( when the old , worn dawny- , and cover feathers ' loss starts ) in ganders , the levels of T , E2 , P4 decrease while DHEA and B significantly increase .	prep_in@ganders prep_of@beginning
prep	At the end of postnuptial molt - when the outgrowth of dawny , cover- , and wing feathers stops - very low T , E2 , P4 , DHEA and T4 levels and and high T3 plasma levels were found in both sexes .	prep_of@end

obj	By contrast , about one-third of SD larvae from which only the brain has been removed , undergo first a larval molt , then pupate and subsequently developed to the adult stage .	obj@undergo

obj	Indeed , the only stages that required elevated salinity were copulation and subsequent oviposition , and we speculate that freshwater inhibits the female pre-reproductive molt .	obj@inhibits
