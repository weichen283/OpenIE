prep#conj	In this paper , we investigated the role of snow depth and melt out date on the phenological development and reproductive success of vascular plants in Adventdalen , Svalbard ( 78degrees 10 'N , 16degrees 06 ' E ) .	prep_out@date conj_and@depth

subj#prep	Thick films ( >4 layers ) are observed to melt heterogeneously , while thin films ( <=4 layers ) melt homogeneously , even for polycrystalline films .	subj@films prep_for@films prep_to@observed
subj#prep	Thin film melting is qualitatively different : thin films homogeneously melt by generating many small defects which need not nucleate at grain boundaries or dislocations .	subj@films prepc_by@generating

obj#prep	For example , a DNA helicase could in principle accelerate branch migration rates by helping to melt the helix at the branch point .	obj@helix prep_at@point
obj#prep	Increased electron dosage appeared to melt the polymer with subsequent movement and attraction toward preferred electron concentrations within the beam .	obj@polymer prep_with@movement

obj#conj	Heating to 58 degrees C was necessary to melt all the crystallized triglyceride and to restore the spherical lipoprotein shape .	obj@triglyceride conj_and@restore
obj#conj	After being exposed to microwave ( MW ) plasma irradiation , the anchored Au NPs melt and fuse , leading to larger aggregates ( 34 nm ) that can connect the MWCNT forming a three-dimensional conducting network .	obj@NPs conj_and@fuse

subj#prep#conj	These chains melt on heating over a temperature range which is solution composition dependent ( ca. 51 to 67 degrees C ) , but in all cases leading to a liquid-like disordered hydrocarbon regime whilst retaining the overall lamellar structure ( and in this state is termed L ( alpha ) ) .	subj@chains prep_in@cases prep_on@heating conj_but@melt
subj#prep#conj	A deep-seated melt or fluid layer on top of the 410-km-deep seismic discontinuity in Earth 's upper mantle , as proposed in the transition-zone ' water filter ' hypothesis , may have significant bearing on mantle dynamics and chemical differentiation .	subj@have prep_on_top_of@discontinuity conj_or@layer
subj#prep#conj	All the three compounds melt well below 100 degrees C and could be classified as ionic liquids .	subj@compounds prep_below@C conj_and@classified

subj#conj	When exposed to direct heating or HIFU , the PCM will melt and escape from the interiors of nanocages through small pores on the surface , concurrently releasing the encapsulated molecules into the surrounding medium .	subj@PCM conj_and@escape
