To this end, a promising group of immune-stimulating agents includes those based on natural interferons (IFNs) [4,5].",

IFN does not act on extracellular viruses and their adsorption [11-13]. IFN is not active inside the cell where it is produced. It must be secreted and then reabsorbed by the cells, where it binds to a corresponding receptor on the cell membrane. There are different types of protein receptors. After binding to cell receptors, the complexes of IFNs diffuse and aggregate on the cell surface. Then, they undergo endocytosis, which occurs after 1-2 h. Getting inside the cells, they activate processes that result in the antiviral state and determine different effects on metabolism. Namely, there takes place the production of different intracellular proteins with oligoadenylate synthetase and protein kinase being the most important and well-studied. These enzyme systems ultimately induce the spread (reproduction) of the virus in vivo, inactivating early viral mRNAs. It inhibits the synthesis of viral proteins on cell ribosomes during viral nucleic acid replication [14,15].",
