On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic [1]. In order to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advice guideline and that has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020 [2]. It has attracted a great attention since published. Note however that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience [3\u20138]; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated. For instance the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People\u2019s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), among 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being substantively changed.",
