CPV2 has a small diameter (about 25 nm), enveloped with an icosahedral capsid. CPV2 is classified within the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, genus Protoparvovirus, and species carnivore protoparvovirus 1 [2]. The viral genome is a single-stranded, linear, negative-sense DNA comprising about 5200 nucleotides. The genome encodes four proteins; two non-structural proteins called NS1 (involved in viral replication) and NS2 (has a role in capsid assembly) and two structural proteins termed VP1 (involved in cell infection) and VP2 (forms the viral capsid and is the main protective antigen) [3].",

In 2005, a Penta Dog inactivated cell culture vaccine containing CPV was prepared [8]. In addition, the effect of different adjuvants on the inactivated canine parvo vaccine was investigated [9]. Egg yolk (IgY) was prepared against CPV conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and horseradish peroxidase. The CPV was adapted among other canine viruses on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells without serum and oral vaccination of puppies was formulated with canine core vaccine including parvovirus [10,11]. Isolation of CPV2 on Vero cells, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequence analysis confirmed the presence of genotype CPV2b in 2012. While in 2014, clustering of the virus within genotypes 2b and 2c was observed [12,13]. Antibodies detected against CPV in domestic dogs, using serodiagnosis, demonstrated high susceptibility of 4-month-old puppies in 2016. In 2018, genotypes 2a and 2b were identified using genetic characterization with special reference to multiple mutations in genotype 2b [14,15]. Genotype 2b is still circulating in Egypt with successful isolation of virus on Vero cells [16].",

The rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 1). This analysis involved 30 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + non-coding.

Out of 50 fecal swabs tested using Rapid CPV/CCV Ag Test Kit, 20 samples were positive (40% of total samples). This test is the most commonly used field diagnostic tool because it is rapid, simple and can be carried out by both veterinarians and owners. However, the sensitivity of this test does not exceed 50% due to large amount of viral antigen required to produce strong visible band. This confirms the high specificity and low sensitivity of the test as previously declared [16].",
