The virus, first named 2019 novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), was later changed to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-COV-2), and the pneumonia was named Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 31, and, as of March 2020, the virus has infected >90,000 people, and killed >3,100 worldwide1. With the number of patients increasing daily, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic intervention. In this article, we will discuss several therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection.",

Probes were based on genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV released by scientists from China. After the development of radiographic pneumonia, the patient was treated with remdesivir intravenously and almost all clinical symptoms resolved the following day2. Remdesivir (Figure 1) is a nucleotide analog originally developed by Gilead as a drug against Ebola virus. Mechanistically, it inhibits RNA-dependent RNA synthetase (RdRp) with completed Phase I and/or II clinical trials3,4. Therefore, Gilead has been working with China since February 2020 to conduct a phase 3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-195. The treatment was designed as 200 mg of remdesivir on day 1 followed by 100 mg/day for 9 days. The study is expected to be completed by May 1, 20206. In addition, other antiviral nucleotide analogs such as fapivir and ribavirin are undergoing clinical trials. Fapivir is a drug approved in Japan for flu treatment.",

Results from in vitro studies showed that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit the replication of both MERS and SARS11. However, whether they can inhibit COVID-19 is unknown. Therefore, a clinical trial to use lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 treatment will be launched soon in a hospital in Wuhan, China. In addition, since darunavir (trade name: Prozekal) is another protease inhibitor used for HIV treatment, a combination of darunavir and ritonavir could also be a potential treatment of COVID-19, especially since darunavir has been approved in China since 2018 for HIV treatment.",

The donated plasma with high-titer of SARS-COV-2 antibodies was confirmed without pathogens and with virus inactivation12. Of note, 12 to 24 hours post-treatment, the major inflammation symptoms decreased significantly with increased lymphocytes counts and blood oxygen saturation. Improved vital signs were also observed. Currently, although the exact underlying mechanisms are unknown, it is reasonable to speculate that the antibodies may bind the virus and prevent virus-host cell interaction, and therefore prevent infection. In addition, NK cells and other immune cells may also be involved in clearing the virus by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, the potential risks associated with plasma usage, including pathogen transmission and allergic reaction, should be considered, and therefore this strategy may only be applied for a clinical emergency following standardized procedures. On the other hand, specific immunoglobulin could be a better option for treating critically ill patients with SARS-COV-2 infection.",

On the other hand, non-neutralizing antibodies may bind the virus and activate the immune cells (mainly macrophages) to engulf and clear the virus. However, excessive activation of these non-specific immune cells may cause the release of a large number of pro-inflammatory factors leading to cytokine storm and sepsis-related death. Therefore, non-neutralizing antibodies play an antiviral role in the early stages but may cause lung damage at later stages. However, it usually takes an extended period of time to generate monoclonal antibodies for a new pathogen that can be used clinically.",
