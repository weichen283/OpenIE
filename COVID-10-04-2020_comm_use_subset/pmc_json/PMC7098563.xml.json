By contrast, there is no such analogous conserved sequence present in all viruses. The lack of a consensus sequence poses a significant challenge for efforts to systematically define the set of viruses present in a given specimen. Rather than simply amplifying and sequencing a signature target locus, metagenomic sequencing of nucleic acid in a sample is required for virus sequences to be represented in a sequencing library. The increased sequencing depth necessary dramatically increases the cost compared to 16S or ITS sequencing. Moreover, the relative abundance of viral to nonviral nucleic acids is an important parameter that drives sensitivity. To mitigate this problem, physical enrichment for viral particles by filtration and/or nuclease treatment is often necessary. Another consequence of the requirement for metagenomic sequencing is that the subsequent bioinformatic analysis is also much more complex; the metagenomic sequences must be aligned at both nucleotide and amino acid levels to large reference databases of viral sequences (not just to a database of reference amplicon nucleic acid sequences). Thus, the experimental sequencing depth, computational infrastructure requirements, and computing costs are significantly higher for virome analyses. The precise experimental and bioinformatic analysis steps utilized can contribute significantly to variability and, in some instances, potentially incorrect conclusions. However, a detailed discussion of both of these is beyond the scope of this review.",

One challenge is that, among those that are alignable to reference viruses, sequences can be misclassified due to the remoteness of the similarity and/or low stringency. An even more significant problem is that in most virome studies, more than 50% of the sequences in virus-enriched preparations have no detectable sequence similarity to any known reference sequences; these unalignable sequences are referred to as viral \u201cdark matter\u201d [8] and may include novel, highly divergent viruses that are unrecognizable. Thus, most current virome studies are presenting only a partial view of the virome because the dark matter sequences are typically ignored. The dark matter clearly harbors hidden treasures because mining of the dark matter has led to discoveries such as crAssphage, the most abundant bacteriophage in human enteric viromes [9].",

This is due in part to the bacterial microbiome being the primary driver of many studies, and thus at the time of sampling, experimental measures to extract DNA were employed without regard to trying to either preserve or recover the RNA. In addition, some studies utilize DNA-specific amplification strategies such as phi29-mediated whole-genome amplification. These studies are unable to assess the RNA component of the virome. Yet the majority of the known eukaryotic viral denizens of the human enteric tract are RNA viruses, such as enteroviruses, rotaviruses, noroviruses, and astroviruses. On the phage side, while it is true that the vast majority of known phages have DNA genomes, the bias of sequencing exclusively DNA has served as a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop; however, recent studies examining samples that have sequenced RNA have demonstrated that there is a much greater abundance and diversity of RNA phages in the world [13]. Thus, in order achieve a more complete view of the virome, it is critical that virome studies be designed such that RNA viruses are preserved in the specimens and that the RNA fraction is incorporated into the sequencing and analysis.",

However, it is not known whether the virome plays a causative role or not. Koch\u2019s postulates remain the gold standard for microbial disease causality, and thus the first step is to establish culture systems for viruses associated with the disease of interest. The lack of culture systems for viruses identified in virome studies, for both eukaryotic viruses and phages, is pronounced. As an example, although dozens of novel eukaryotic viruses have been identified in the mammalian enteric tract by metagenomic sequencing, culture systems for only a very limited number have been described to date [14, 15]. Likewise, for phages, genomic sequences of thousands of novel phages can be identified in a single study [16, 17], but very few have been isolated [18]. Thus, while (in the past) discovery of novel viruses was rate limiting, today the rate-limiting step has shifted to development of culture systems for the viruses that have been molecularly identified.",

In all likelihood, no effort has been made to culture the vast majority of the novel viruses identified in virome studies, and some will surely succumb to standard culture conditions once applied. Limitations in quantity or quality of primary specimens containing viable virus can contribute to the problem. In part, it is challenging for labs to obtain funding to culture novel viruses, particularly in the absence of any strong disease association. Moreover, the risk of a negative result, exemplified by many decades of unsuccessful attempts to culture human norovirus, is substantial. Nonetheless, given that the lack of ability to culture a virus is perhaps the most fundamental barrier to progress in the study of that virus, dedicated efforts to develop culture systems are absolutely necessary.",

For example, the respiratory viruses bocavirus and coronavirus HKU1 can be propagated using primary airway epithelial cells [19, 20]. In the enteric tract, the development of enteroids and organoids and recognition of the need for additional enteric tract components have opened the frontier for propagation of human norovirus [21, 22]. Broader application of these systems will undoubtedly lead to increased success in culture of some eukaryotic viruses. On the phage front, one significant challenge is that many of the bacterial host species are themselves unculturable using standard bacterial-growth media. Thus, efforts to propagate novel phages will also entail improving systems for bacterial in vitro growth. Some approaches toward this include development of bioreactors [23, 24] and other systems that better mimic the natural environment [25], but additional new and innovative strategies are needed.",

In bacterial microbiome studies, a powerful approach has been the ability to colonize mice with either a single defined bacteria of interest or a consortia of bacteria. By analogy, it would be ideal if the virome could be functionally interrogated in similar fashion. However, a prerequisite for eukaryotic viruses is that one must first be able to establish infection in the relevant animal model. As with establishing cell-culture systems, the paucity of animal-infection models for novel viruses stems in part from lack of effort to develop such systems. Moreover, the challenge is exacerbated by the multitude of potential infection routes that need to be evaluated, need to overcome the immune response, cross-species transmission barriers, and (even within a species) potential impact of varying genetic backgrounds. Use of transgenic animals that are immunodeficient [26] or that have been partially humanized [27] has enabled development of murine models for some viruses. In an ideal world, animal models for all eukaryotic viruses identified in virome studies would be established, enabling the roles of any single virus (or cocktail of viruses) to be functionally evaluated. Likewise, having an extensive library of cultivated phages (see above) will allow them to be combined in defined proportions along with eukaryotic viruses for experimental studies. For phages, presuming they act by modulating the bacterial community, the animal model must harbor the relevant bacterial host species, and thus the bacterial microbiome may need to be manipulated as well. Notably, some recent studies have suggested that phages may also interact directly with eukaryotic host cells [28, 29]. Overall, significant effort and resources must be expended to establish robust animal-infection models suitable to define the role of the virome. This is a step that is absolutely necessary in order to move virome studies beyond the realm of mere association studies.",

Lack of familiarity with the field and relevant experimental approaches often limits further investigation. These communities have been largely segregated, often holding separate conferences and distinct grant-review panels. To illustrate this point, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) virology study sections address only \u201cnon-bacteriophage viral genetics, infection and replication, cellular and host responses to viral infections, and mechanisms of viral disease pathogenesis.\u201d Thus, there is a great need to bring these disparate communities together in order to collectively attack questions associated with the virome, especially as more complex trans-kingdom interactions are identified linking phages, bacteria, eukaryotic viruses, and eukaryotic cells.",
