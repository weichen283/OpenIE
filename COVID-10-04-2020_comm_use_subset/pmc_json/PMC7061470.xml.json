Since the first case was reported in Wuhan (China) on December 8, 2019 [2], until February 27, 2020, a total of 78,497 cases have been confirmed, 32,495 cases recovered and 2744 cases died in China [3]. Up to date, the outbreak has already been spread to 37 countries worldwide and a total of 2918 cases have been confirmed, 287 recovered, and 43 cases died [4, 5]. Had it not for the whole society effort led by the Chinese government, the situation would be much worse in China and around the world. For better global actions, there is a urgent need for public reporting among Nations and further global surveillance.",

Scientifically framed epidemic information about the outbreak can help people understand the developing situation, encourage the whole society to work together against the epidemic, and help prevent data from deliberate misinterpretation. In theory, all relevant information can be reported to support decision making, while such approach takes a lot of time and make it impossible to do so. Therefore, for timely public reporting, selecting the most representive indicators are of most importance. China is the first country to fight the outbreak and have accumulated lots of exprience. Its experience to report the indictors information to the public on daily basis is very useful not only for the World Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen global surveillance, but also for other countries to improve their public reporting.",

These data together with the updates from the WHO have provided good basis for visual reporting at city, provincial, national, and international levels. Ratio analyses such as case fatality rate, recovery rate, etc. are applied to reflect the whole progress of various effort and interventions. These rates are further classified as Hubei, outside Hubei, whole China, etc. for comparison in curves. It should be noted that there are lots of influential factors affecting the fatality and recovery rates [8], for example, the fatility rate in Hubei is much higher than other provinces (4.03% vs 0.80%, by Feburuary 27, 2020), which can be partly explained that, even though Hubei is abundant of health resources, but still lacks enough medical resources to provide timely and effective treatments to the hug number of patients compared with much less patients in other Chinese provinces.",

However, with the outbreak developing into a global pandemic, many countries are still underestimating the impact of the outbreak. The following aspects can be highlited for public reporting, surveillance and actions:\nThe number of deaths can further be classified by gender and age. In this way the information will be much helpful to further identify susceptible populations.According to China\u2019s practice, the number of confirmed cases is better to include only laboratory confirmed cases, and all clinically diagnostic cases should all be included into suspected cases before they are confirmed by laboratory tests. However, this creates the difficulty for countries lacking test capabilities and they will need assistance from the international community.Including up to date incidence and case mortality rate of the coronavirus infections based on the total population will help the general public better assess the impact and reduce overreacted social panic.For public reporting, countries especially those with suspected and confirmed cases of the COVID-19 should actively report to the WHO for further collaborations. Further relevant technical supports are required to construct a visual reporting system, with data and information coming from government daily updates and social media.It is important for other countries to timely share the indicators information with the WHO, and a global visual surveillance system is increasingly required, together with current modules in daily situation report, travel advice, technical guidance, and global research [9].",
