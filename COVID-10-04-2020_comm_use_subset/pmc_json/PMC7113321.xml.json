These are (i) the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; (ii) evidence of local transmission; (iii) the overall health security preparedness rank (i.e. level of preparedness), as reported in the GHS Index and (iv) the passenger volume to a PICT airport. For each risk element, we assign a score out of three. For the \u2018number of confirmed cases\u2019 element we assign a score of \u20181\u2019 if WHO reported less than 20 confirmed COVID-19 cases, \u20182\u2019 if there was between 20 and 150 reported cases and \u20183\u2019 if there were more than 150 reported cases. For the evidence of local transmission element, we assigned a score of \u20181\u2019 if WHO reported \u2018imported cases only\u2019 or \u2018under investigation\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 if WHO reported \u2018local transmission\u2019. For the \u2018overall health security preparedness rank\u2019 element, we assign a score of \u20181\u2019 if the country was categorised (in relation to all other countries) as \u2018most prepared\u2019 in the GHS Index, \u20182\u2019 if categories as \u2018more prepared\u2019, and \u20183\u2019 if categorised as \u2018least prepared\u2019. While for the \u2018passenger volume\u2019 element we assign a score of \u20181\u2019 if the estimated number of passengers arriving from a country to a PICT airport was less than 10 000 per annum, \u20182\u2019 if it was between 10 000 and 100 000 and \u20183\u2019 if it was more than 100 000. We then added the risk element scores and if the sum of the scores was less than 7, we describe the risk of COVID-19 importation from the respective country to be in the \u2018lowest\u2019 likelihood category, if the sum of scores was between 7 and 9, we describe the risk as being in the \u2018moderate\u2019 likelihood category and if the sum of scores was greater than 9, we describe the risk as being in the \u2018highest\u2019 category.",

Central to this plan should be efforts to protect health systems and populations in less well-resourced PICT settings. This may include implementing key COVID-19 response activities, such as passenger screening and symptomatic case management at major regional transit hubs (i.e. Fiji in the south Pacific and Guam in the north Pacific) to prevent importation and risk of community transmission in less well-equipped states; drawing on regional resources, such as laboratories in Fiji, New Caledonia and French Polynesia, Guam and Hawai'i, that have advanced testing capabilities; and deployment of emergency medical teams, where necessary.",
