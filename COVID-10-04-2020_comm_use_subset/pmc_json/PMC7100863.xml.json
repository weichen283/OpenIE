Emotional expressions in the corpus of 424 700 tweets were assessed based on the coding results of their corresponding original tweets.

Anger was coded for when one or more synonyms of anger (irritated, outraged, mad, upset) was used or a tweet clearly blamed an entity, and sadness was coded for when its synonyms (sorrow, grief) were used or when other-oriented protection was mentioned. Tweets were coded as positively valenced when they explicitly stated happiness, content, satisfaction, encouragement, and their synonyms, and coded as neutral when they only tweeted or re-tweeted news-like headlines without adding further information.",
