They occupy a broad range of different ecological niches (2), have an exceptional longevity (8\u201310) and a natural and unique resilience against various pathogenic viruses (1,11). For example, bats are the suspected reservoirs for some of the deadliest viral diseases such as Ebola and SARS (12\u201314), but appear to be asymptomatic and survive the infection. Possibly, the solution to better understand and fight these pathogens lies in the uniquely developed immune system of bats (15,16). Studying bats and their genomes is likely to have high impacts on various scientific fields, including healthy ageing, immune and ecosystem functioning, the evolution of sensory perception and human communication, and mammalian genome architecture (see the recent Bat1K review for further details (2)).",

We compare our new annotations with the currently available annotations for bats and show that a large number of non-coding genes are simply not annotated and are therefore overlooked by other studies. We used six RNA-Seq data sets comprising different conditions (Table 2) to validate our annotations and to determine the expression levels of our newly annotated ncRNAs. Exemplarily, we show that our novel annotations can be used to identify ncRNAs that are significantly differential expressed during viral infections and were missed by previous studies.",

For reference mapping, Huang et al. also used the M. lucifugus genome, so we were theoretically able to directly compare our annotations with the annotations of both studies. Unfortunately, no positional information (annotation file) of the identified miRNAs derived from the transcriptomic data of M. myotis were given in the manuscript or supplement (8). Therefore, we blasted the precursor miRNA sequences identified with the help of the M. myotis transcriptome against the M. lucifugus genome and retained only hits with a sequence identity of 100%. The so obtained positional information was further used to calculate the overlap between our predicted miRNAs in M. lucifugus. We used the same approach for the P. alecto comparison. If the annotated location of an miRNA and one of our identified miRNA locations in M. lucifugus/P.alecto were overlapping by at least 85 %, we counted this location as a common prediction.",

The transcripts were used as input for a BLASTn (2.7.1+, 1e\u221210) search against each of the 16 bat assemblies (compiled as BLAST databases). The BLASTn result for each bat assembly was further processed to group single hits into potential transcripts as follows: first, for each query sequence q \u2208 H, hits of q found on the same contig c and strand s were selected (hitsc, s, q) and the longest one, q1, was chosen as a starting point so that trscpc, s, q = (q1). Second, all hits qi \u2208 hitsc, s, q with qi\u2209trscpc, s, q, which overlap neither in the query q nor in the target sequence and do not exceed a maximum range of 500 000 nt from the most up-stream to the most down-stream target sequence position of all qj \u2208 trscpc, s, q\u222aqi, were added iteratively to trscpc, s, q. To this end, we introduced a simple model of exon\u2013intron structures, naturally occurring when using transcript sequences as queries against a target genome assembly. We defined the 500 000 nt search range based on an estimation of lncRNA gene sizes derived from the human Ensembl (37) annotation. If the sum of the lengths of all qi \u2208 trscpc, s, q covers the query transcript length lengthq at least for 70 %, trscpc, s, q was considered as a transcript and its elements qi as exons, otherwise all qi \u2208 trscpc, s, q were withdrawn. This procedure is repeated until all hits \u2208 hitsc, s, q were used or withdrawn. Therefore, each so-defined group of non-overlapping hits derived from the same query sequence and found on the same contig and strand should represent a lncRNA transcript with its (rough) exon structure. The defined transcripts were saved as BLAST-like output and transformed into GTF file format. To follow the GTF annotation format and to harmonize our lncRNA annotations with the other ncRNA annotations, each lncRNA transcript was also saved as a gene annotation and consists of at least one exon.",

For EHE, we found a possible mtDNA contig in full-length (16 141 nt; AWHC01200796) in the genome assembly. Due to the circularization of mtDNA, we rearranged the sequence of this contig to start with the gene coding for the phenylalanin tRNA and to match the gene order of the other mitochondrial genomes. Only for ESP, RSI, MLY, EFU and MNA, we were not able to detect any possible contigs of mtDNA (Table 3). All 11 mitochondrial genomes were annotated with MITOS (49). The ncRNA results were filtered by e-value (threshold 0.001), thus one of two small rRNAs in MBR and RFE and one of two large rRNAs in EHE were discarded as false positive hits (Supplementary Table S10). For the five bat assemblies directly including mtDNAs (Table 3), the MITOS annotations were added to the final merged ncRNA annotation.

The currently available bat genomes vary widely regarding their assembly quality and completeness (Table 1 and Figure 2; Supplementary Table S1) and were predominantly assembled by using short Illumina-derived reads and low (\u223c18 X) (51) up to moderate/higher coverage (77\u2013218 X) approaches (52\u201356,25). A new assembly of the cave nectar bat (Eonycteris spelaea) (57) was exclusively generated from long-read data derived from the PacBio platform, and the genome of the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (58) was assembled by using a hybrid-approach of Illumina and PacBio data. These two genomes from the Pteropodidae family are of a generally higher quality (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1).

Accordingly, the available bat genome annotations vary a lot regarding their quality, ranging from more comprehensive annotations for long-standing bat genomes such as M. lucifugus or P. vampyrus to annotations on region level, completely missing any coding or non-coding gene annotations at the current NCBI version (Figure 3 and Table 4). Furthermore, by using strand-specific RNA-Seq data, we could show that some genes (e.g. IFNA5/IFNW2 in the Ensembl annotation of M. lucifugus (26)) are annotated on the wrong strand and are therefore entirely missed by differential expression studies when relying on a strand-specific read quantification. For all publicly available bat genomes, ncRNAs are generally annotated on low levels and are highly incomplete, mostly only comprising some tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs and lncRNAs (Figure 3 and Table 4). Therefore, many ncRNAs, especially miRNAs, are simply overlooked by current molecular studies, for example from RNA-Seq studies that aim to call differential expressed genes based on such in-complete genome annotation files. Studies that have made additional effort on annotating ncRNAs in bats (8,25,47,60\u201361) are not reporting their results on a level that can be directly used for further computational assessment (e.g. as a direct input for RNA-Seq abundance estimation).",

Note that we refer throughout this paper to an RNA-Seq data set by the first author\u2019s name and the year of the respective data set publication. The only included data set derived from a species of the Yinpterochiroptera suborder (R. aegyptiacus) was obtained from a study dealing with the differential transcriptional responses of Ebola and Marburg virus infections in human and bat cells (16) (data set: H\u00f6lzer-2016). In this study, total RNA of nine samples of R06E-J cells, either challenged by the Ebola or Marburg virus or left un-infected, were harvested at 3, 7 or 23 h post infection (poi) and sequenced. Unfortunately, no biological replicates could be generated for this study. Therefore, we did not use this data set for the differential expression analysis, but also calculated normalized expression values (TPM; transcripts per million) as done for all RNA-Seq data sets. The other five data sets comprise Yangochiroptera species of the Vespertilionidae (M. lucifugus, M. daubentonii) and Miniopteridae (M. natalensis) families (Table 2). Field et al. conducted two transcriptomic studies (27,28) (Field-2015, Field-2018) using wing tissue of the hibernating little brown myotis bat. They were especially interested in transcriptional changes between un-infected wing tissue and adjacent tissue infected with Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungal pathogen that causes the white-nose syndrome. Two other data sets were obtained from virus- (RVFV Clone 13) and interferon (IFN) alpha-induced transcriptomes of a Myotis daubentonii kidney cell line (MyDauNi/2c). RNA of mock, IFN and Clone 13 samples were gathered at two time points, 6  and 24 h poi (26). From the same samples, rRNA-depleted (H\u00f6lzer-2019) and smallRNA-concentrated (Weber-2019; see Methods section for details) libraries were generated and sequenced. Finally, we used data of the long-fingered bat M. natalensis initially obtained to characterize the developing bat wing (25). Here, total RNA was extracted from paired forelimbs and hindlimbs from three individuals at three developmental stage.",

In general, replicates of virus-infected and IFN-treated samples 24 h post infection tend to cluster together only based on the expression profiles of small ncRNAs (mainly miRNAs) (Figure 4A and B). Most differences can be observed between the 24 h virus-infected and all other samples, which seem to show no clearly distinguishable expression pattern. Interestingly, at 6 h post infection, we see replicates clustering together regardless of their treatment (mock, IFN, Clone 13). Thus, after only 6 h, few miRNAs are differentially expressed and therefore the samples of each replicate (mock, IFN, Clone 13) cluster together, because they have the same passaging history but the passaging history in between the replicates differ (26). After 24 h, more and more miRNAs are significantly differentially expressed and the samples can be better distinguished based on their treatment (Figure 4A and B). We observed that, in general, miRNAs tend to be down-regulated (Figure 4B; upper half), while snoRNAs tend to be up-regulated (lower half) after 24 h of Clone 13 infection compared to mock. For example, we found a novel miRNA (MLUGD00000002094 in our annotation; predicted by mirDeep2; Supplementary Table S7) located in an intron of the protein-coding gene SEMA3G, significantly down-regulated (log2 fc = \u20132.56) during Clone 13 infection (Figure 4C and D).

As also shown in the heat map (B), replicates tend to cluster on the basis of their passaging history, except for virus- and interferon-treated (IFN) samples 24 h post infection. (B) A heat map and hierarchical clustering for the same 150 most highly expressed ncRNAs that were used for PCA (A). The clustering was performed on DESeq2-normalized read counts and scaled on rows to visualize changes in expression on ncRNA level. Most differences can be observed between the Clone 13-infected samples 24 h post infection and all other conditions. Due to minor changes in miRNA expression levels, the other samples tend to cluster on the basis of their passaging history and not on the basis of their treatment. In general, miRNAs tend to be down-regulated (upper half), while snoRNAs tend to be up-regulated (lower half) after 24 h of Clone 13 infection. (C) Selected expression box plots of four highly expressed ncRNAs. Shown are DESeq2-normalized expression counts. The miRNA mir-1307 and a novel mirDeep2-predicted miRNA are significantly (adjusted p-value < 0.05) down-regulated at 24 h post virus infection. The C/D box snoRNA SNORD62 and a Y RNA are up-regulated.
