Village doctors have been changed from self-employed to public service providers, playing a basic net role in China\u2019s rural health care system. They are responsible for providing rural residents with life-cycle care involving prevention, treatment, health protection and rehabilitation, as well as two-way referral between village clinics and urban general hospitals, so that village doctors are the indispensable gatekeepers of health for the vast majority of rural residents in China [1]. With a rural population over 900 million, village doctors in China conduct a much broader scope of work compared to other countries. With the rapid development of China\u2019s economy in recent years, the overall quality of village doctors, their service facilities, and the impartiality and accessibility of health services for rural residents have been continuously improved [2].",

The new national essential drugs system requires village doctors to use essential medicines and sell them to patients at zero-profit purchase price, shifting village doctors\u2019 income from drug prices to local government compensation. The low level of government compensation and the delay in obtaining it have greatly reduced the income of village doctors. In 2014, village doctors\u2019 average monthly income in Beijing, an economically developed area in China, was only 1293.07 yuan (166.637 euro) [3]. Meanwhile, In rural areas there are many serious dilemmas cannot be ignored, such as urgent demand for medical care, poor working conditions and environment, unsmooth promotion mechanism, limited training opportunities, lack of supervision and competition system, aging village medical team, and shortages of new doctors with professional knowledge and comprehensive quality [4], low income and rural residents\u2019 distrust of their medical qualifications and medical technology make the occupational environment of village doctors increasingly severe [5]. All these factors have been confirmed to have an impact on village doctors\u2019 burnout and subsequently turnover [3, 6]. The detection rate of job burnout among village doctors was as high as 68.6, 45.3% of which had high turnover intention [7]. Recently, China\u2019s Henan province witnessed two serious cases of village doctors\u2019 collective turnover, one involving 36 doctors and the other 28 doctors. As an important part of China\u2019s medical and health service team, when village doctors leave collectively, rural medical institutions may face a \u201cstall\u201d and rural residents may be trapped in incurable difficulties, resulting in more serious social consequences [1, 8].",

Research on turnover can be traced to 1958 when March and Simon established the participant determination model [7, 10]. Subsequently, scholars have developed a series of theoretical models on turnover research; although the emphases of such models are different, they all state that turnover intention is the main cognitive precursor of turnover behaviour and has a strong explanatory power [11, 12]. Compared with turnover behaviour, turnover intention can better reflect the real management level of an organization. Based on this, this study found that it is more meaningful to explore turnover intention than actual turnover behaviour. Hence the turnover intention of village doctors, rather than their actual behaviour, is the theme of this study.",

Numerous studies have analysed the influencing factors of doctors\u2019 turnover intention, including a country\u2019s medical system, occupational environment, doctor-patient relationship, level of employment and alternative job opportunities, and other external environmental factors [3, 16\u201318]. Internal individual factors include gender, age, marital status and work ability [4, 19, 20]. The most widely studied job-related factors including working hours, salary levels, social security, job stress and burnout, emotional commitment, job autonomy, fairness of remuneration [21, 22] were always incorporated into studies to explore the comprehensive impact on turnover intention. However, these researches have not involve the impact of resilience. At the same time, the existing studies have mostly used the t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and chi-square test, as well as multivariate statistical analysis to analyse the influencing factors of turnover intention [3, 4, 16\u201322]. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) can not only accurately and quantitatively measure the correlation between observed variables, but also track and deeply dig the correlation between latent variables, and even the causal relationship between measured variables. Therefore, this study adopted SEM to deeply explore the linear regression relationship between variables, which can make up for current studies\u2019 limitations.",

Many empirical studies on medical staff have found that job satisfaction is negatively related to turnover intention, and influences it through direct and indirect paths [8, 24, 25]. Recently, a meta-analysis also demonstrated a significant negative correlation between job satisfaction and turnover intention among nurses [26]. In rural South Africa, improving job satisfaction by increasing wages, unblocking promotion channels, and improving guarantees was crucial to reduce the turnover intention of urban primary care physicians [27]. Furthermore, job satisfaction is often the mediator between other factors and turnover intention, for instance, through the mediating effect of job satisfaction, professional identity had an indirect negative effect on turnover intention among township health inspectors in China [7]. The doctor-patient relationship and work engagement also played an indirect role in nursing staffs\u2019 turnover through job satisfaction in southern Italy [28].",

In countries or regions with limited medical resources, the work engagement of medical staff, in contrast to job burnout and high turnover intention, is recognized as an irreplaceable and much-desired organizational asset [30]. Personal characteristics such as psychological status, job identity and personality affect work engagement. Meanwhile, available work resources, organizational support and fairness, and other work characteristics are also highly positively correlated with work engagement [31, 32]. Accordingly, the outcome variables of work engagement include organizational variables such as organizational efficiency and performance, and personal variables such as job burnout and turnover intention [33, 34]. The total score of work engagement, vigour, dedication and absorption are negatively correlated with turnover intention. Some studies have explored the mediating role of work engagement in turnover intention [28, 35, 36]. Silvia De Simone et al. found that patient satisfaction had a negative effect on nurses\u2019 turnover intention through the mediating effect of work engagement in southern Italy [35]. A cross-sectional and correlational study in a Portuguese hospital revealed the mediating effect of job engagement between social support, job satisfaction and turnover intention [37].",

This can be explained by the concept of individual resilience, which refers to a person\u2019s ability to recover from traumatic or painful events and achieve good adjustment and higher development [20]. Research have shown that individuals become stronger, more confident and more productive by experiencing stressful events and overcoming them through resilience [38]. In addition, resilience may not alleviate the stress experienced by village doctors, but it can improve their ability to overcome stress and predicament, thereby improving job satisfaction and work engagement, and reducing job burnout and turnover tendency [39]. A national survey of nurses\u2019 turnover intentions in South Korea found that resilience and work engagement mediated the effect of work satisfaction and burnout on turnover intention [40].",

Our study also inquired into the current quality of village doctors. Only 71 (2.6%) had university qualifications or above, and less than 5% had middle and senior professional titles. Although the Chinese government has further lowered the professional title assessment requirements for village doctors, many village doctors still cannot meet the requirements for middle and senior professional titles, which also impacts their income. Chen Zhongqiang, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), found in a rural survey that with no chance of promotion and low pay, village doctors were not treated as well as veterinarians, and even switched to veterinary medicine [50]. Meanwhile, the aging demographic of doctors has become an international issue, and is even more serious in terms of village doctors due to comparatively less funded rural medical resources. Our survey shows that 1987 (73.7%) of village doctors were 40 years old or above, and only 36 (1.3%) were under 30 years old, hence, the age structure of such doctors is older than that of the doctors in city\u2019s third level hospitals (32.51% aged 40 and over, 17.84% aged 30 and under). At the same time, due to the influence of family structure, health literacy, and lifestyle, the health evaluation age of village doctors is higher than that of urban doctors of the same age, so the retirement of older village doctors is also a reason for high turnover intention. Therefore, more researches are urgently needed to explore the key factors and influencing mechanism of village doctors\u2019 turnover in order to alleviate the phenomenon of village doctors\u2019 massive turnover in China.",

Hodges HF et al. found that enhancing the psychological resilience of nurses in emergency medical center can significantly reduce their turnover rate. Wang M et al. found that the resilience of nurses in first-class tertiary hospitals in China played an intermediary role in job satisfaction and turnover intention. The reason why our finding is different from the above results may be that village doctors mainly deal with frequent and common diseases, and their work stress, work intensity, work trauma and other factors that affect their resilience are lower than hospital nurses, so resilience are not the direct reason for village doctors to leave. However, the study proved that resilience affected turnover intention indirectly through the mediating role of work engagement, and played a significant mediating role in job satisfaction and work engagement. These findings indicated that job satisfaction and work engagement were necessary ways for village doctors to transform the unification of personal value and professional value into continuing their rural medical work. Inspired by these mediation paths, interventions that can sufficiently lower the turnover intention of village doctors should be encouraged. The Chinese government should increase investment in village doctors\u2019 income, establish a long-term, reasonable, and effective promotion mechanism, and provide social security to improve the work efficiency and engagement of village doctors. Another possible strategy is to reduce the work loads of village doctors, improve their resilience, and guide them towards positive coping approaches in their daily work.",

The reason was that resilience cannot directly affect turnover intention, but rather through the mediating effect of work engagement. Hence, this suggests a more sophisticated and in-depth mechanism in the relationship between resilience and turnover intention. However, the research on the resilience of village doctors is very insufficient at present. In the future, we should not only study the influencing factors, but also study the effective intervention measures of the resilience, and construct perfect protective intervention measures of village doctors from the perspective of predictors, so as to improve their resilience. In addition, because resilience is a multi-dimensional, subjective variable, it is difficult to obtain in-depth and detailed understanding through quantitative research. In the future, qualitative research methods should be adopted to conduct micro and in-depth exploration on the resilience of village doctors.",

Work-related dimensions should be paid attention to, including establishing effective promotion mechanisms, increase training opportunities, and providing higher and more reasonable income. Simultaneously, qualitative research should be used to explore the factors influencing resilience in depth and detail, and the protective intervention measures should be structured from the perspective of predictors, so as to improve the resilience of village doctors and their adaptability to stress. In this way, the high turnover rate of village doctors should be effectively contained, and the medical team working in China\u2019s rural primary medical care can develop stably and dynamically.",
