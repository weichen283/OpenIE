Since 2019-nCoV is also infectious in the incubation period, we introduced parameter \u03b22 here to represent the probability of S to E after E contact S.

This study used the latest 2019 nCoV data in Wuhan area, analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 2019 nCoV epidemic after Wuhan city was shut down. Compared with other studies, the R0 value produced in this study is smaller, indicating that the closure and subsequent measures have played an important role in the spread of the epidemic.",
