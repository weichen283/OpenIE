The two novel fatal coronaviruses emerge periodically in different areas, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. Given the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses, the genetic diversity and frequent recombination of genomes, and increasing human and animal activities, novel coronaviruses are likely to emerge periodically in humans owing to frequent cross-species infections and occasional spillover events [7, 8].",

It can be propagated in the same cells for growing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Notably, 2019-nCoV grows better in primary human airway epithelial cells than in standard tissue-culture cells, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. It appears that 2019-nCoV uses the same cellular receptor hACE2 (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as SARS-CoV [11], it seems the transmission may develop after signs of lower respiratory tract disease.",

Most importantly, in the earliest case, the patient became ill on the 1st December 2019 and had no reported access to the seafood market. And no epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. It seems that the seafood market is not the only origin of the virus. The virus probably came into the market place first then it went out of there [12]. Analyses of blood samples in China from people and animals from other animal markets may reveal a clear picture of where the 2019-nCoV originated.",

According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reported that laboratory tests ruled out SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens. CDC considered the 2019-nCoV as a possible pathogen causing the outbreak [16]. The 2019-nCoV can cause severe illness in old patients with comorbidities and transmit readily among people [17]. At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3% [3], compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO [16, 18].

And the ground glass changes on chest CT scan were earlier than the positive for RT-PCR test in some cases. Repeat testing of nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples are recommended in clinical suspected cases with an initially negative result. According to the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, respiratory and eye protection, and hand hygiene are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.\n",
