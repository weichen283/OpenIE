Undoubtedly, the successive large-scale outbreaks of SARS (Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome) and H1N1 make them more enthusiastic about this study. Complex\nnetworks as a new branch of statistical physics provide a reliable model for the intensive\nstudy of the epidemic spreading. When studying the epidemic spreading in complex networks,\nresearchers usually adopt the homogeneous network structure1\u20138 and homogeneous mixing3,9\u201311 hypotheses. As research\nprogressed, researchers began to discuss the credibility of the homogeneous network\nstructure hypothesis and take into account the inhomogeneity of the network structure.1\u20135,12 In this study, we try to\ncheck the credibility of the homogeneous mixing hypothesis, meaning that each infected\nindividual has the same probability of contacting with any susceptible (healthy)\nindividual,13 which has not been well\ndiscussed until now.",

As\nthe infected individuals always infect their neighbors, we predict that the spreading of the\nepidemic may actually be inhomogeneous. That is, the probabilities of infected individuals\nconnecting with susceptible ones differ significantly. To investigate the inhomogeneity, we\nperform large scale numerical simulations on static and dynamic networks. In these\nsimulations, we study two spreading modes of the SIS model.
