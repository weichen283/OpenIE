The first category comprises those provinces that have large-scale short-term business trips or tourist populations in Wuhan during the Spring Festival holiday, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hainan. Obviously, such a high level of inter-provincial population mobility may exacerbate the spread of 2019-nCoV. For example, the high ratio of confirmed cases in Guangdong Province may be due to the large short-term travel populations visiting Shenzhen and Guangzhou and Wuhan, while the high ratio of confirmed cases in Hainan Province may result from the outbound tourist population from Wuhan to Hainan during the Spring Festival holiday. In Table 10, the results are divided into two parts: the correlation coefficient of the first category of provinces, which reaches a maximum of 0.96, and the correlation coefficient of the second category of provinces, which increased from 0.56 to 0.7. This abovementioned second category comprise the other 25 provinces that have small short-term business trip groups or tourist populations in Wuhan during the Spring Festival holiday. We assumed that the effect of the floating population on the spread of 2019-nCoV was consistent across the country. The other 25 provinces are divided into three groups since 25 January 2020 (Figure 4): (1) Provinces with a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases, namely Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Yunnan; (2) Provinces with a moderate increase in the number of confirmed cases, namely Hunan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hebei, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Qinghai, Jilin, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Ningxia; and (3) Provinces with a small increase in the number of confirmed cases, namely Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi.

We found that: (1) The epidemic growth model of Henan Province does not fit the situation in most other provinces. That is, except in Anhui and Jiangxi, the actual number of outbreaks in other provinces was higher than that predicted by the Henan model. As these provinces have large floating populations in Wuhan, the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi may result from effective measures that have been taken to control the spread of 2019-nCoV, or the lack of sufficient diagnostic capabilities to detect suspected cases. (2) The epidemic growth model for Hunan and Sichuan Province predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. Thus, if the epidemic pattern in Hunan and Sichuan follows a typical evolutionary pattern, the current numbers of confirmed cases in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi are greatly underestimated. For example, the number of confirmed cases in Henan on 31 January 2020 would be between 860 and 889, but the number in official announcements was only 168. In contrast, the number of confirmed cases in Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Yunnan Provinces were higher than the predicted number, which may be affected by uncontrollable local factors that need further investigation. (3) The epidemic growth model for Zhejiang Province predicts a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in most provinces, especially Jiangsu and Fujian provinces that are adjacent to Zhejiang. It is important to investigate why there were so many confirmed cases in Zhejiang, and whether the outbreak in Jiangsu and Fujian Province was not detected in a timely manner, or whether all possible cases have not yet occurred.",

The Spring Festival in 2020 is much earlier than in previous years. At this time, the possibility of human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus had just been discovered. When the Wuhan Municipal Government decided on 23 January 2020 to \u201cclose the city\u201d to control the outflow of population, more than 5 million people had already left Wuhan on the Spring Festival holiday, and it was too late to control the entire potentially infected population in the epidemic area. At present, China\u2019s high-speed railway and expressway transportation network has experienced great development. This fast and convenient transportation has led to a floating population that can leave the source area to quickly reach every part of the country, which makes it very difficult to quarantine the floating population leaving the source area through transportation stations. In addition, there is an incubation period after human infection, further increasing the difficulty of quarantine at traffic stations, which is also an important reason for the implementation of \u201ccity closure\u201d control policies in many cities across the country.",

It fully investigated and isolated the population of Wuhan, and also publicised the severity of the epidemic, and also increased awareness of the prevention of infectious diseases and raised people\u2019s vigilance through messages on television, mobile communications and the Internet. In addition, according to the latest epidemic surveillance, the incubation period of the coronavirus is 3 to 7 days, with an upper limit of 14 days. For this reason, the central government has issued an executive order to extend the Spring Festival holiday from 30 January to 2 February 2020. Many provinces are even requiring firms to not restart work until 9 February, except those necessary for social operations related to the national economy and people\u2019s livelihood. Extending the holiday is needed to avoid the returning people leaving home early and returning to work, so as to minimise the risk of the epidemic spreading again due to population fluctuations.",

For example, some are college students, because Wuhan is the city with the largest number (>1 million) of college students in China and the world. The other parts include short-term business travellers, transit passengers and tourists. Official media reported that the size of the populations during the Spring Festival holiday would reach more than 30 million. This can be confirmed from the daily-confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection. Although there is a small permanent population in Wuhan whose household register belongs to provinces and cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hainan, and Guangdong (in fact, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are two megacities), these provinces and cities still have large-scale temporary floating populations from and to Wuhan because of the large population and well-developed economy. Therefore, the number of confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection in these areas is far ahead of that in most other provinces that have a large floating population in Wuhan. ",

At present, some cases have been confirmed in surrounding Asian countries, Europe, North America and Australia. Third, limited to interdisciplinary research capabilities, our model does not include infectious disease analysis models such as SIR to further analyse the potential and scale of 2019-nCoV spread, which may reduce the value of this research in the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections. Finally, the results of the study are mainly applicable to the end of the Spring Festival holiday, and after the large-scale population comes back to work or study, the spread of the epidemic will be more complicated.",

Due to the fact that 5 million migrants had left Wuhan before the \u201cclosure of the city\u201d, our research reveals a high correlation between the number of Wuhan\u2019s floating population and the number of confirmed cases. Fortunately, the origin of Wuhan\u2019s floating population is highly concentrated in Hubei Province and its surrounding provinces, of which the migrants with Hubei household registers account for 75%, and more than 80% of the population is concentrated in the top 30 districts and counties. This means that some areas will face a very high risk of epidemic outbreaks, but it is also conducive to centralised resources enabling prevention and control of the epidemic to avoid large-scale spread in other regions.",

Due to China\u2019s urban and rural dualistic structure, most of these people are rural migrant workers with low levels of education. The results find that 85% of the migrants have rural household registers. These people, who frequently work outdoors or work overtime are more likely to be susceptible because of their poor diet and nutrition. At the same time, most of these people travel with 3\u20134 family members, and the susceptible and high-risk population over 40 years old accounts for a large proportion of this floating population, which provides ideal conditions for the transmission of 2019-nCoV within families. To make matters worse, the rural areas where these people return to have very limited medical and public health services, and gatherings during the Spring Festival aggravate the risk of virus transmission in the community.",

The results of our model analysis indicate that, on the one hand, the correlation between the size of the floating population and the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan has continued to increase over time, and by 28 January, the correlation coefficient of these factors in Hubei Province had reached 0.78, which means that the size of the floating population in Wuhan is an important parameter for predicting the epidemic. On the other hand, we also found that the effect of the size of the floating population in Wuhan is heterogeneous across regions. Some areas have a large floating population in Wuhan, including Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, and Xiaogan City, Jingzhou City, and the three county-level cities directly under the provincial government, and yet the number of confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV is apparently relatively small. However, we believe that the epidemic situation in these areas may be underestimated. Considering the serious consequences of delays in diagnosis and loopholes in infection control in suspected or confirmed cases of SARS in the SARS epidemic in 2003, it is necessary to strengthen surveillance in these areas to determine the causes of the fewer confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in these areas.",
