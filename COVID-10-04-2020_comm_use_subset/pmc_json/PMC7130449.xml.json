Pneumonia mostly occurs in the second or third week of a symptomatic infection (3). Comparison of hematological parameters between mild and severe cases of COVID-19 showed significant differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-Dimer, glucose (GLU), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (4). Fan et al. analyzed the hematological indices of COVID\u201019 infected patients between the intensive care unit (ICU) and non\u2010ICU patients. They showed lymphopenia and raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were associated with higher rate of ICU admissions. Patients who were transferred to the ICU had a lower nadir lymphocyte count, nadir monocyte count and nadir hemoglobin, and higher peak Neutrophil (NEU) Count and peak LDH levels compared to patients who did not require ICU stay (5) . Many patients with MERS-CoV had liver function abnormalities with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and LDH (6). Also laboratory data on SARS have shown that most patients had elevated CRP levels, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and elevated levels of aminotransferase, LDH and creatine kinase (7). A series of recently published articles have reported the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 disease, but data regarding the laboratory characteristics of infected individuals are limited (8-10). This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19.",

Another study indicated that 2\u201311% of patients with COVID-19 had liver comorbidities and 14\u201353% of cases had abnormal ALT and AST levels during progression of COVID-19 disease (12). Furthermore, Shi et al. studied patients whose COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan while in the subclinical phase and found that incidence of AST abnormality among these patients was significantly lower than those diagnosed after the onset of symptoms (13). Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases compared to mild cases of COVID-19. In another report, Yang et al. found no difference in the incidence of abnormal liver function between survivors (30%) and non-survivors (28%) (9). Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment (12).",

In comparison to the normal range, we found low WBC and LYM counts in patients with positive RT-PCR COVID-19, whereas NEU counts were higher in these patients. In previous reports, low LYM and WBC counts were found in most patients, which is in line with our study (14). Laboratory studies showed leucopenia with leukocyte counts of 2.91 \u00d7 109 cells/L, 70.0% of which were NEU (15). Therefore, our result suggests that NEU might not be affected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial phase of the disease. It also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory tract and infect other cells, inducing series of immune responses, and causing changes in number of peripheral white blood cells such as lymphocytes (11). Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus affects many immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function (11). Tsui and others reported that high neutrophil count on admission of COVID-19 patients, and elevated LDH level were independent predictors of an adverse clinical outcome (16).",

The AUC of laboratory parameters such as ALT, CRP, AST, LDH, and NEU indicated that they could be used to predict the presence of COVID-19 disease, while those of albumin and WBC were below the reference line of ROC curve, indicating that they were poor predictors of the disease. The data is in line with results reported by Wang et al. (17) and Gao et al. (4). In the current study, the AUC of CRP, ALT, LDH, urea and NEU were above 0.80; thus, they are effective and have very good predictive value for predicting COVID-19. It seems that, some blood laboratory parameters could be used in screening cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19.",
