The purpose of this priority list is to identify high-threat pathogens for which there is a need to prioritize and advance the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Any diagnostics, drugs, or vaccines that are developed as a result of this and other initiatives, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, will need to be fully evaluated in diagnostic evaluation studies or phase II and III clinical trials.",

For example, during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, case fatality rate (CFR) estimates varied widely from 0 to 13 500 per 100 000 laboratory-confirmed infections, with a heterogeneity of 99.97% (using I2 estimate) [2]. A therapeutic trial designed with patient survival as a primary outcome measure would have grossly misjudged the required sample size if the trial was designed using the wrong CFR. Therapeutic trials for the prevention of congenital Zika syndrome will be hindered by the absence of consistently used criteria to define the outcome of congenital malformations [3]. For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a lack of systematic biological sampling means that disease pathophysiology and factors associated with more severe disease and viral clearance (a commonly used secondary outcome measure) are not well understood [4].",

Often lost to competing priorities for clinicians during outbreaks, standardized data collection regarding the presentation and natural history of disease, biomarkers of disease severity, and response to supportive care can be sporadic or missing. While these data have their most important benefits in improving patient management (through better recognition of disease complications and informing supportive care) and public health control, patient-based data are also used to determine key parameters for clinical trials, such as the inclusion criteria, the nature and rate of clinically relevant outcomes, and potential confounders. We suggest that adoption of clinical case registries (such as those used for rare cancers) provides a feasible option to produce standardized clinical data that have multiple clinical, public health, and research benefits [6].",
