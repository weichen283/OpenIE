It has further challenged the scientific and industrial community for quick control practices, and equally importantly to develop effective vaccines to prevent its recurrence. In facing a rapid epidemical outbreak to a novel and unknown pathogen, a key bottleneck for a proper and deep investigation, which is fundamental for vaccine development, is the limited -- to almost no -- access of the scientific community to samples from infected subjects. As such,\nin silico predictions of targets for vaccines are of high importance and can serve as a guidance to medical and experimental experts for the best and timely use of the limited resources.",
