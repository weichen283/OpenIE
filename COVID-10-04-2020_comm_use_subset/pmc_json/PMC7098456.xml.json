As the epidemic progresses, there remains little understanding of infant and childhood COVID-19 infections and their clinical picture. As of 22 February 2020, 77,043 cases of novel COVID-19 infections have been confirmed and 2,445 people have died (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/). During this epidemic, four live-born infants were born in our medical center, to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection. Three of the four pregnant women gave birth by cesarean section due to concerns about symptomatic maternal infection. The other infant was born by vaginal delivery to a mother experiencing fever (highest temperature 38.3\u00b0C), with a diagnostically confirmed infection. The most important question is whether the COVID-19 could be transmitted vertically to the fetus from the pregnant mother and cause a clinically significant infection. Recently, a finding from nine other cases suggested that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy (1). We believe this present report is the second case report on vertical transmission between COVID-19 pregnant women and their infants. Moreover, this report will focus more on infants. This case report describes the clinical course of four live born infants born to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection.",

On admission, the regular symptoms of pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were fever (three out of four patients), cough (two out of four patients), myalgia or fatigue (two out of four patients), and headache (two out of four patients). Only one patient felt reduced fetal movement and one experienced dyspnea. Lymphocytes were below the normal range (lymphocyte count <1.1 \u00d7 109/L) in all patients, and two patients showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1.0 \u00d7 109/L). Both leucocytes and platelet counts were below the normal range (white blood cell count <4 \u00d7 109/L, platelet count <100 \u00d7 109/L) in the mother in Case 4 (shown in Table 1). The mother in Case 3 developed anemia (hemoglobin 83 g/L) and dyspnea 5 days after being admitted. There was a significant increase of the level of C-response protein in all pregnant mothers. Coagulation function and blood biochemistry of all the mothers were normal. Five respiratory pathogens (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Respiratory syncytial virus, Adenovirus, and Coxsackie virus) and the nucleic acid of influenza viruses A and B of all patients were negative (laboratory findings shown in Table 1). An RT-PCR assay confirmed that the throat swab of the four pregnant women were positive for COVID-19. Abnormalities in chest CT images and bilateral involvement were detected among all pregnant women. A cesarean section was performed for three patients in the acute phase of the disease while one patient underwent vaginal delivery because of the onset of labor. Four full-term infants were born. All infants were isolated from their mother immediately after birth. We describe the clinical course of these four infants (laboratory findings shown in Table 2). Three mothers of the infants recovered from their COVID-19 infections and were released 3\u20135 days after delivery. However, one mother suffered severe dyspnea after delivery which required respiratory support\u2014she did, however, survive. All four infants and their mothers were healthy upon a post-discharge follow-up.",

In these four pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection, three had fever, two had a cough and experienced headache. In laboratory data, there was lower lymphocyte count and higher CRP in blood analysis. Typical CT images of COVID-19 infection with ground glass changes were presented in these pregnant patients. These four pregnant women had no critical maternal illness. Only one of them experienced reduced fetal movement and one had dyspnea. These symptoms, at onset of delivery, were similar to other populations (8). To prevent COVID-19 intrauterine, perinatal, and postnatal transmission, three pregnant women received a cesarean section. One of the three pregnant women suffered placenta previa, which made it necessary to opt for a cesarean section. Only one pregnant mother adopted a vaginal delivery because of an emergency labor process.",

It was reported that 12 pregnant women were diagnosed to have the SARS infection during the outbreak in Hong Kong (10). Seven mothers presented in the first trimester, and the rest were in their late second and third trimester. It was reported that the SARS infection in pregnant women could lead to severe intrauterine growth retardation, which could be due to the prolonged usage of high dose systemic corticosteroids or antiviral agents and/or the impact of a severe maternal debilitating illness on normal fetal growth (9, 10). In this study, all four cases reported on were delivered during the acute phase of the illness, at 37\u201339 weeks of gestation, and the birth weight of all the babies were appropriate for their gestational age.

In this study, blood assays of the three infant cases were normal, and all the blood cell counts and hemoglobin concentrations fluctuated within the normal reference range. It is worth noting that both Case 2 and Case 3 presented a transient skin rash after birth. Whether this was attributable to the maternal inflammatory toxin effect requires further study. At follow up, the four newborns were health and had grown on formula feeding.",

A recent retrospective analysis in adults showed that the sensitivity of RT-PCR is 71% for COVID-19 infection (13). Therefore, the reliability of diagnostic testing should be further evaluated, especially in children. Another limitation of this report was the small number of cases, and imperfect clinic data. No COVID-19 vertical transmission was detected. Further studies for viral infection in placenta, amniotic fluid, neonatal blood, gastric fluid, and anal swab, and the viral depending receptor on children will be detected in future.",
