Fecal contamination in the feed supply chain may enter with ingredients or from cross-contamination during the manufacturing, transportation, and storage of feed (Cochrane et al., 2016a). Thermal processing helps reduce the risk of this transmission but is a point-in-time mitigant that offers no residual protection from post-processing cross-contamination (Cochrane et al., 2017). Biosecurity can limit this cross-contamination but is challenging to implement across the feed manufacturing and delivery industry (Cochrane et al., 2016a).",

Currently, it is unknown, if the specific ratio of MCFA needs to be utilized to reduce PEDV. Furthermore, it is not known if a specific fatty acid is driving the response to the MCFA blend, or if it is simply an effect of added fat in the diet. The MCFA blend has also been applied using a special aerosolized nozzle to reduce droplet size which is a similar process used for the application of commercial formaldehyde-based products (Cochrane et al., 2015, 2016b). This would require special equipment to be installed into feed mills thus making it more difficult to utilize MCFA in complete swine feed. It is unknown if direct addition to the mixer would be sufficient for MCFA application making the use of MCFA a more realistic approach.",

However, other countries utilize fat sources such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil which contain higher levels of MCT and MCFA. However, it is not known how effective the products would be as a PEDV reduction strategy because of the MCFA being contained within the MCT molecules. These fat sources would be significantly lower cost than the MCFA sources and are widely available.

In all bottles except the negative controls, 2.5 mL of inoculum was added to the 22.5 g of each feed treatment. Each bottle was thoroughly shaken to ensure equal dispersion of the virus, resulting in each inoculated bottle containing feed with a PEDV concentration of 104 TCID50/g.",

The Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed all pigs negative for PEDV, porcine delta coronavirus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus by fecal swab. Blood serum analysis further confirmed no prior PEDV exposure through analysis of PEDV antibodies by an indirect fluorescent antibody assay. Pigs were allowed 2 d of adjustment prior to beginning the bioassay. A total of 45 pigs were individually housed, and 1 pig challenged via oral gavage for each of the 3 replicate batches of feed.

In general, the 1% MCFA blend performed similar to previous research by Cochrane et al. (2016b). However, this experiment goes further than previous research to identify the most effective components of this MCFA blend. The mitigation success of the 1% MCFA blend is driven by caprylic acid and caproic acid, as they provided the greatest reduction in detectable PEDV (35.5 and 36.3 Ct, respectively) compared with capric acid (32.4 Ct). While, the 0.66% inclusion of any of the three led to a negative bioassay, none had a similar reduction in detectable PEDV of the 1% MCFA blend (37.4 Ct). This suggests there is a possible synergistic effect of the MCFA when in combination with one another, but additional research is necessary to identify the minimum inhibitory concentration of MCFA alone or in combination with various feed matrices.",

This in turn causes pores to be created altering the cellular membrane and leading to cell death (Desbois and Smith, 2010; Kim and Rhee, 2013). Because of this mode of action with bacteria, we hypothesize that the greater efficacy of the blend and shorter MCFA may be due to how these specific fatty acids interact with the lipid and protein components of the envelope of the virus. Specifically, we believe that the relatively neutral pH of MCFA allows these fatty acids to interact with the lipids within the viral envelope. This would then cause pores to be created and lead to destabilization of the viral envelope with an effect similar to the bacterial mode of action. If this mode of action is true, then the viral envelope would not be able to attach to the host and lead to no replication.",

However, pigs receiving the coconut oil treatment had delayed clinical signs of PEDV. Based on its fatty acid analysis, coconut oil had the greatest MCFA concentrations of the natural fat sources. The total quantity of caproic, caprylic, and capric acids in the final diet were 0.11% or 0.21 in the 1 or 2% coconut oil treatments, respectively. While this is lower than 0.66% of each individual fatty acid or the 1% MCFA blend that demonstrated no infectivity, the small quantity of MCFA in the coconut oil may have led to a delay in PEDV infectivity. Another natural fat source with known levels of MCFA is palm kernel oil, but the concentration of caproic, caprylic, and capric acids was lower than in coconut oil. Treatments with palm kernel oil had no protection from PEDV. Furthermore, the MCFA in either the coconut or palm kernel oil treatments were presumably MCT. It is thought that longer MCFA, such as lauric and myristic acids, are too lipophilic to approach the PEDV cellular membrane, while those bound in a triglyceride need hydrolysis from lipase to carry on its mode of action.",

            "text": "In summary, this research suggests a specialized aerosolized nozzle is not necessary to apply MCFA for PEDV mitigation. It was also demonstrated that 0.66% caproic, 0.66% caprylic, and 0.66% capric acids have similar efficacy as commercial grade formaldehyde or the 1% MCFA blend when placed into a 10 d old swine bioassay. Interestingly, pigs given the coconut oil source with the highest composition of caprylic and capric only showed signs of infectivity on the last day of bioassay. Unfortunately, it was also shown that these MCFA are more effective at mitigating PEDV than longer chain fatty acids or triglycerides. However, further research needs to be carried out to evaluate alternative MCFA combinations, and MCFA concertation levels against PEDV.",
