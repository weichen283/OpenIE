It is an enveloped virus containing a positive-sense RNA genome that is 27.6 kb in length, coding for at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs) characterized by the following organization: 5\u2032UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3\u2032UTR. The first two-thirds of the genome comprises the replicase gene, which is expressed through 2 polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved by 2 types of virus-encoded proteinases, resulting in 15 non-structural proteins. In addition, the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), integral membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N), and a set of accessory proteins [2].",

With the advent of reverse genetics systems (RGS) for coronaviruses, accessory proteins have been proved to be generally dispensable for replication in vitro [4\u20138]. Furthermore, some of these studies have shown that coronavirus accessory proteins are involved in virus\u2013host interactions during coronavirus infection in vivo [5, 6, 8]. Until recently such studies were not possible for IBV, as the only reverse genetics system available was based on Beaudette, a non-pathogenic and highly cell-adapted strain that is unable to replicate in vivo [9]. In our laboratories a RGS for IBV strain H52 has been recently developed, based on targeted RNA recombination and the rescue and selection of recombinants in embryonated chicken eggs [10]. The rIBV H52 lacking the gene clusters 3ab and/or 5ab [11], showed a remarkable reduction in virulence in 1-day-old chicks. In addition, they had the ability to induce sufficient immune responses to protect against virulent IBV of the Mass genotype upon challenge [11]. However, the deletion of complete gene clusters did not allow us to investigate the involvement of each individual accessory protein in the reduction of virulence.",

Statistical analysis showed a significant difference (P<0.05) in ciliary activity between the deletion mutants and rIBV-wt in infected chickens (Fig. 6). There was no significant difference between the two wild-type viruses. The cumulative ciliostasis scores from rIBV-\u03943a-, rIBV-\u03943b-, rIBV-\u03945a-, or rIBV-\u03945b-vaccinated animals differed from those of the non-vaccinated controls (P<0.05).",

            "text": "Subsequently we investigated whether IBV accessory proteins are involved in evading the immune response of the host. Viral replication in a host relies on the ability of the virus to delay or counteract the type I IFN response [13] and accessory proteins of other members of the family Coronaviridae are known to be involved in the mechanisms to escape the type I IFN response [7, 9, 14, 15]. As the immune system in ECEs becomes fully functional during the last week of embryonic development (from about 14 days of age) [16], we initially tried to assess the type I IFN response in our bioassay using the allantoic fluid collected from 16-day-old ECEs infected with deletion mutants and wild-type viruses. However, the results obtained were inconclusive (data not shown), probably due to the presence of luciferase inhibitors in the AF of the ECEs [17, 18]. We consequently adopted an in vitro approach in which we infected CEK cells with rIBVs and used the collected inactivated supernatants from these to perform the type I IFN luciferase bioassay. rIBV-\u03945b showed an earlier onset of type I IFN production in comparison with both the wild-type viruses and the other single-deletion mutants, as indicated by an increase in the luciferase activity. This finding is in accordance with a previous study, which identified protein 5b as being responsible for the shut-off of the host translation machinery for the cell culture-adapted IBV Beaudette [19]. As a consequence of the inhibition of protein translation, no type I IFNs are synthesized. Compared to the wild-type viruses, an early onset in type I IFN response was also observed for rIBV-\u03943a and rIBV-\u03943b (30 h p.i.); protein 3a was previously reported to be involved in counteracting the antiviral IFN response [20], while protein 3b was found to be involved in the inhibition of Ifn\u03b2 transcription [21]. Taken as a whole, these data are consistent with previous observations in studies using the non-pathogenic strain Beaudette, in which IBV accessory proteins 3a, 3b and 5b acted as type I IFN antagonists.",

All rIBV single mutants showed an attenuated phenotype in comparison to the wild-type viruses. Of all the recombinant viruses tested, rIBV-\u03945a showed the most attenuated phenotype in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the involvement of protein 5a in the pathogenicity of IBV. The data gathered in this study suggest that protein 5a is not a type I IFN antagonist and that it is dispensable for replication in ovo. Similarly, the deletion of gene 6 from SARS-CoV does not affect the replication in vitro, but results in lower titres and lower morbidity and mortality in vivo [22]. We can speculate that protein 5a acts as a co-factor in the replication in vivo and that its deletion results in lower viral replication rates in chickens and consequently in an attenuated phenotype.",

Animals were inoculated via eye-drop with 103 EID50 in 0.1 ml of IBV H52 BI (n=15), rIBV-wt (n=15), rIBV-\u03943a (n=15), rIBV-\u03943b (n=15), rIBV-\u03945a (n=15) and rIBV-\u03945b (n=15), or not inoculated (n=10, negative control), respectively. At 7 days post-infection the animals were humanely killed for sampling of the trachea and subsequent evaluation of the ciliary activity. Briefly, for each trachea ten 1 mm transverse sections were collected (three upper, four middle and three lower) and examined under low-power microscopy. The ciliostasis of each tracheal section was scored on a scale from 0 (100 % ciliary activity) to 4 (no ciliary activity), and the average ciliostasis score was calculated for each group of animals [26]. Eventually a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post hoc test was performed to analyse whether the average ciliostasis scores between the groups were statistically different.
