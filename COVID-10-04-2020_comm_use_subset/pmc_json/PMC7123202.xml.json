In poor communities, a large part of the population live in overcrowded and squalid conditions. In these communities, mostly in the major cities of developing countries, there is a lack of clean drinking water, poor hygiene and sanitation. This environment creates opportunities for waterborne diseases and different forms of pollution. It is in the slums of the main cities of developing countries that most EIDs begin and spread and it is also in such areas of the cities that the greatest number of deaths are usually recorded. Infectious diseases like Ebola, HIV, TB, usually spread easily and widely from poor communities in emerging cities and through health workers who serve such communities. Hence, poverty creates a favourable condition for the spread of infectious diseases and makes it difficult for affected people to get adequate access to prevention and care (WHO 2012a, b). The journal of Infectious Disease of Poverty was launched in 2012 with the principal aim of fostering \u201cinterdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research that explicitly highlights the intersection of poverty and other ecological factors with disease\u201d (Xia et al. 2013).",

Farmer (1996) observed that their emergence and spread appear to be high in areas with huge social inequalities. Additionally, EIDs are more common in areas rich in wildlife and zoonotic pathogens from wildlife while vector-borne pathogens are more concentrated in lower latitudes, such as tropical Africa, Latin America and Asia (Jones et al. 2009). Also, specific EIDs appear to be common within certain geographical regions. For example, EVD has mainly been in sub-Saharan Africa while the ZVD has been largely limited to the Americas, situations which might be associated with the geographical location of the vectors that spread the disease. Different authors have developed global maps highlighting the areas where EIDs have originated or are most likely to originate. These areas have been described as EID \u2018hotpots\u2019. One of those maps has been developed by Morse and colleagues, and illustrates the risk of emergence of infectious diseases originating from wildlife as shown in Fig. 18.2 below (Morse et al. 2012).\n",

The major factors include ecological changes (including those due to economic development and land use), human demographics, behaviour, international travel and commerce, technology and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and breakdown in public health or control measures (Morse 2004). Examples of specific factors affecting infectious disease emergence is shown on Table 18.1. There is a direct correlation between poverty and the emergence of infectious diseases which can be seen through different factors. For instance, the ecological footprint left by humankind is evident by the direct impact on the land, air and water of a specific area or region, used to sustain the depletion of natural resources for an individual or a community.\n",

The index case for the West African Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak, lived in a district known as Maliandou, in a village called Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, in Guinea- Conakry (Mar\u00ed Sa\u00e9z 2014). This area is known as the Forest Region, however only approximately 20% of the trees are still standing. The area has lost most of the vegetation due to the mining of iron ore, bauxite, gold and aluminium (Mar\u00ed Sa\u00e9z 2014). Wild animals have lost their ecosystems and many use the roofs of thatched huts to nest, living in closer proximity to the villagers. The few remaining trees, are colonized by bats and other animals. It is thought that the insectivorous bats in the hollowed-out tree, in the yard of the index case, may have been the reservoir for the Ebola Virus, Zaire strain (EBOV). Research shows that this particular species (Mops condylurus) are able to survive infection by EBOV (Mar\u00ed Sa\u00e9z 2014). Amongst the first twelve EVD cases, none were hunters and the index case, was a toddler which led epidemiologists to believe that domestic spaces were in danger for the spread of the disease. Clearly, close living proximity between the bats and the people of the village provides circumstantial evidence of the mode of transmission of this disease, given the issues with deforestation (Borchert et al. 2015).",

As has been demonstrated in the earlier sections, developing regions (mostly low and middle-income countries) and impoverished communities and people tend to bear the brunt of EIDs and it negative impacts. Considering the prevailing situation, it would be expected that any efforts in managing the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease would place more attention and resources in addressing the root causes, especially in developing and low-resource countries. Additionally, one will expect that countries and regions with relatively lower capacity to detect these diseases should receive more attention as the pace with which disease outbreaks are recognized is critical for establishing effective control efforts (Kluberg et al. 2016). However, existing evidence suggests that global resources devoted to countering the emergence of infectious diseases are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate (Jones et al. 2009). This raises serious ethical issues as it would be expected that for a more effective global response to the prevention and control of EIDs, more resources should be channeled to regions and countries with the greatest risk of experiencing the emergence of these diseases.",

In the past, vulnerability to EIDs and other health challenges was defined by geographic location and economic factors, but because of the high level of international interactions and movement of persons and goods across borders, this is no longer the case. And since those in affluent countries benefited from the accident of geography and climate as well as efficient health infrastructures which protects them from many threats to EIDs, it is difficult for many to identify with vulnerable people in poor countries. On the contrary, poor people, as a result of their geographical location (mostly in tropical regions) with harsh climatic and economic situations, weak and inefficient health infrastructures; lack access to the health goods needed to prevent them from EIDs (West-Oram and Bux 2016, 1). However, because of globalization and climate change, the tides are changing and vulnerability is being redefined. Today, protection or exposure to EIDs and other tropical diseases is no longer determined by geographical location or economic situation; \u201call persons are increasingly united in their vulnerability to emerging threats\u201d (West-Oram and Bux 2016, 1). There is need for global cooperation and solidarity between the affluent and poor nations. This can only be effective if both parties identify with each other and acknowledge their shared vulnerability. For example, with the ease in international air travels, an EID in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) or Asia can reach Europe or the USA within a couple of hours.",

While EVD-infected expatriate health personnel were flown to their countries for treatment, local EVD-infected health personnel were not accorded such treatment. This attitude was motivated by the failure to recognize the similarity between citizens in rich and poor countries which emerging health threats has exposed us to in our increasingly interconnected interdependent world. It further reflects the discrepancy that existed in international health in the past which does not longer hold today. This calls for a paradigm shift from the charity-based approach to a solidaristic one (West-Oram and Bux 2016, 7). An approach that acknowledges our global interdependence and shared vulnerability to global health threats such as EIDs; and recognizes that if a neighbour\u2019s home is on fire, efforts must be made by all to put off the fire, otherwise it may spread and consume more homes (including ours) that may even be further away from the initial home on fire! In fact, the WHO has proposed solidarity as one of the key ethical principles in the management of infectious disease outbreaks globally (WHO 2016). This principle justifies engagement in collective action in the face of common threats such as EIDs, while supporting efforts to overcome inequalities that undermine the well-being of minorities and groups suffering from discrimination. One potential application of this principle globally is the provision of financial, technical, and scientific assistance by high income and developed countries to low-income and impoverished countries to boost their capacities to prevent and manage ongoing and future EIDs. This is in fact one of the obligations of governments and the international community in the WHO \u2018Guidance for managing ethical issues in infectious disease outbreaks\u2019 (WHO 2016).",

Moreover, solidarity does not require that only the rich should identify with the poor; it involves identifying with all persons be they rich or poor. For example, during EVD outbreak in West Africa in 2013\u20132016, most African countries and the African Union were sluggish in taking the lead in the fight against the disease (Metz 2017). By the time Western countries had pledged 1 billion US dollars, African countries had barely managed to raise $700.000.Cuba, alone, had sent more than 400 health workers whilst the AU had just started deploying only 100 medical personnel (Metz 2017).

EIDs have contributed in exacerbating global health inequalities as most areas where EIDs are common are also areas that experience lack of access to basic life-saving and preventive medicines. For any fight against these diseases to be successful, mechanisms must be put in place to redress these determinants as well as bring together the intellectual, financial and health resources of the world for all, especially people from low and middle-income countries where the local capacity to appropriately manage EIDs is relatively weak. This is because in our interconnected and interdependent world, no individual, group or nation is insulated from the threats of EIDs. It is important that rich countries play a fundamental role in dedicating resources and increasing funding for research in capacity-building and drugs for EIDs in developing countries, not only because their own populations are also vulnerable to EIDs, but also for the sake of global solidarity. Also, the countries where EIDs are more likely to occur and those whose capacity to effectively manage EIDs is weak, must also play a leading role in addressing the socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions which facilitate the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.",
