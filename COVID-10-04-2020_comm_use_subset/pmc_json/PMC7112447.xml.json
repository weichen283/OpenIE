For example, the world wide web can be considered\nas a network of websites with hyperlinks. The Internet is formed by routers with physical\nconnections. Similarly, the human brain can be also regarded as a system of neurons linked\nby synapses. Many other examples can be also found: the global economy, market, food cycle,\nmetabolism, disease spreading, computer virus, energy diffusion, etc. Recently, research in\nthe area of complex network has advanced significantly and will lead to a deeper study and\nmore practical applications in future. Synchronization dynamics and epidemic dynamics are\ntwo of the main research fields in complex network science. In the last ten years, with the\nimportant discovery of small-world and scale-free networks, synchronization in complex\nnetworks has attracted great attention.1\u201313 Epidemic\ntransmission in complex networks has also become an important research focus as it offers\npotential to advance the simple assumptions of homogeneously mixed models.14\u201319",

            "text": "Since synchronization and epidemic spreading are apparently two quite distinct behaviors,\nthere is very little work to consider them together. Actually, synchronization and epidemic\nbehavior on networks can arise simultaneously and interplay adaptively. Many realistic\nepidemic networks have displayed statistically synchronized behavior that we define as the\nepidemic synchronization which, for the moment, can be classified as epidemic\ninduced synchronization and epidemic characteristic\nsynchronization. For examples, with the spread of SARS (the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome), Bird Flu, or H1N1 influenza, people will spontaneously take some\nprotective measures such as washing hands frequently with clear water and soap, avoiding\ngoing to crowded place, and so on in order to improve self-protection.20 When rhinoceroses and hippopotami are infected with\nepidemic ringworm, they will spontaneously go to a lakefront to have a bath in mud which\nwill also provide either cure or protection. As the spread of these epidemic diseases\nbecomes weak, these spontaneous protective behaviors (in either humans or animals) will\ndecrease accordingly. Here, we choose to describe these consistent human or animal\nbehaviors, which result from epidemic spreading, as the epidemic induced\nsynchronization. For another example, weekly measles case reports21 for Birmingham, Newcastle, Cambridge, and\nNorwich between 1944 and 1958 have shown their singular oscillatory behavior and an in-phase\nsynchronized pattern between Birmingham and Newcastle, but an anti-phase pattern between\nCambridge and Norwich. Similarly, the reported cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea for the\nMidwest, South, Northeast, and West cities in United States between 1941 and 2002 have also\nexhibited the oscillatory characteristic and phase synchronized patterns.22 In addition, collective synchronization\ninduced by epidemic dynamics on complex networks has also been studied numerically.23 For integrality, we define here these\nconsistent oscillation of measures, which quantify the epidemic degree or other\ncharacteristics and do not refer to concrete human or animal behaviors, in epidemic networks\nas the epidemic characteristic synchronization. In this paper, we just\naddress the epidemic induced synchronization.",

Since this analysis can be generalized analogously to the model of SIR\nepidemic synchronization (7), we omit this generalization for simplicity. The network\nembedded in model (6) is made to be the BA (the Barabasi and Albert model) scale-free\n(preferential attachment) network28 with\nsize N = 500. This network evolves from initial network with size\nm0 = 4 and we add each new node with m = 3\nnew edges. Without loss of generality, we suppose that the f in model (6)\nis defined as the chaotic Lorenz oscillation. Certainly, this assumption is rather difficult\nto justify from the point of view of a physical epidemic transmission process, but we just\nuse it for numerical simulations. This oscillation can be described as {dx1(t)dt=a1(x2(t)-x1(t))dx2(t)dt=a2x1(t)-x2(t)-x1(t)x3(t)dx3(t)dt=x1(t)x2(t)-a3x3(t)(14)\nwhere parameters a1 = 10, a2 = 28,\nand a3 = (8/3). H is chosen as the identity\nmatrix. The Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the changes in synchronization\nerror e(t), epidemic prevalence\nI(t), and coupling strength\nc(t) in the model (6) with epidemic rate\n\u03bb = 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. Here, the synchronization error is\ndefined as e(t)=\u2211j=2N\u2016x1(t)-xj(t)\u2016/N.\nFrom Fig 1, we can see that\nI(t) \u2192 0(t \u2192 \u221e), i.e.,\nthe epidemic does not break out. In this case, the synchronization error\ne(t) does not converge to zero, which means that the\nepidemic dynamics cannot successfully induce the synchronization of individuals under small\nepidemic rate \u03bb = 0.02. From Fig 2, we\ncan see that I(t) converges to a positive number and\ne(t) converges to zero, which implies that the epidemic\ndynamics can induce successfully the synchronization of individuals with larger epidemic\nrate \u03bb = 0.1. Increasing further the epidemic rate to 0.2, we find that the\nepidemic dynamics can not only induce successfully the synchronization, but also enhance the\nspeed of synchronization. These simulations show that if the epidemic transmission spreads\nmore easily on the network, then the epidemic dynamics can induce the synchronization of\nindividuals more effectively. This is consistent with the attained theoretic results in Sec.\nIII\u2014an aggressive disease leads to a strong\nresponse from individuals.\n",
