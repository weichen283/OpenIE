In the COVID-19 suspected case definition, several scenarios based on whether local transmission is occurring are considered. If local transmission is not taking place, epidemiological criteria, such as a history of travel or residence in a country/area reporting local or community transmission may be part of the suspected case definition. In Scotland, the first suspected case of COVID-19 was identified on 23 January 2020 [8]. It was evident that the ambulance services and the hospitals could be rapidly overwhelmed, particularly if the case definition widened, due to the consideration of more geographical areas abroad with local transmission, or if local transmission would begin in Scotland itself, leading to dismissal of epidemiological criteria all together. This was evident when HPS and PHE adopted a broader number of countries in the case definition than that used by ECDC on 25 February 2020. The threat of COVID-19 has required healthcare services to react and adapt their working patterns. There was no available guidance or similar service in Scotland yet when the COVID-19 Community Testing Team was initiated. Other services were in development across the UK, but these were also in their infancy [9].",

In order to detect and control an outbreak, community sampling should be a priority. The COVID-19 Community Testing Team quickly identified that sampling in patients\u2019 homes was a necessary service to ensure rapid testing and safe containment. The Chief Medical Officer in Scotland stipulated in a communication on 13 February 2020 [11] that all suspected cases of COVID-19 should be sampled within 24 hours of presentation.

This is a national resource reserved for transportation of suspected HCIDs and is thus limited. Prioritisation of the use of this service depends on clinical need and thus there was often a delay before transport could be arranged. As at 5 February 2020, 27 suspected cases had been tested in Scotland, with more awaiting testing. This meant a considerable strain on the ambulance service. Once used, the ambulance and examination room within the hospital both required terminal cleaning and decontamination following use by a single patient, which further limited resources available. This route was expensive, resource intensive, added pressure to a hospital system already under strain from increased winter admissions. The limited capacity due to the surge of cases in the RIDU led to patients with complex infections being unable to access admission for specialised services. Ultimately, the process for sampling was highly disruptive and difficult, especially for clinically stable cases who nevertheless had to face a lengthy wait and exposure to a highly medicalised setting. Many suspected cases of COVID-19 had mild symptoms and did not require hospital assessment or admission. Patients were triaged by their GP service, and a specialist in Infectious Diseases or Public Health reviewed referrals. Community sampling enabled the ambulance service to have more capacity to respond to clinical urgent cases, and ensured inpatient beds were available for those in need.",

Subsequent to this study, we developed a \u2018drive through\u2019 service for those able to access private transport safely. This greatly increased capacity of the service with 313 individuals sampled at the \u2018drive through\u2019 in a 14-day period between 28 February and 13 March 2020. The original Community Testing Team remained in situ during this period to sample individuals who could not attend the drive through service. We recommend that other services review their population to understand which model is most appropriate. Our population included a large number of students who do not have access to private transport and so a fixed site was not chosen as the initial model. ",

            "text": "Our model for community testing was adopted across other health boards in Scotland, and informed national guidance on community testing. It met the target time period between presentation and sampling set by the Scottish Government. It avoided significant expense of unnecessary admissions. Most importantly, it was successful in avoiding a large number of resource intensive hospital admissions for testing for SARS-CoV-2 that could have put the healthcare system at risk of exposure to COVID-19. Community sampling is an intrinsic part of the response to COVID-19 and can be carried out safely, efficiently and effectively. However, after further widening of the suspected cases definition, which accounted for an increase of geographical areas presenting risk for potential exposure abroad by HPS and PHE [5], the Lothian team witnessed a surge of referrals. Indeed, following the case definition widening on 25 February 2020, 49 suspected cases were referred for sampling in 48 hours, compared with 79 over the 14-day period in this study (6\u201320 February 2020). To meet this increased demand, we adapted our model to a fixed site, or \u2018drive through\u2019. This commenced on 28 February [13]. Local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland and the UK nevertheless started with as at 19 March 2,644 confirmed cases in UK [14]. One possible reason may have been the mild course of COVID-19 in a relatively large proportion of those infected [15], so that such people unknowingly contributed to ongoing transmission. Facing the larger local spread of disease, the UK moved from applying containment to delay and mitigation measures [16]. Moreover, due to capacity reasons, testing could no longer be offered to people with minor symptoms from 12 March onwards [17]. All this may have affected the approach to community testing. Measures to increase testing capacity are nevertheless currently being taken [18]. Healthcare services, and the UK and Scottish Governments, must recognise the importance of maintaining isolation of suspected cases and avoiding unnecessary contact with healthcare settings, and direct resource into facilitating community testing as far as possible. Healthcare staff should have ongoing training in these areas, including PPE use, fit testing and community experience, in order to ensure staffing resilience in response to a HCID.",
