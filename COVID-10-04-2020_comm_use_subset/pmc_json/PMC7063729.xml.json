The validity of this statement has unfortunatly been confirmed by both the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and COVID-19 outbreak in China. Critics of current and past outbreak responses highlight the need to consider political and security, as well as biological, threats to effective responses [2], and the consequences of failing to address socio-economic and cultural dynamics, such as those related to gender inequities, within health crises [3]. While there is widespread recognition of policy failures during outbreaks, there is little discussion on how policy-makers, global health organizations and health professionals can better prepare and respond [4].",

In particular, structural drivers of outbreaks, such as gender inequities and other social determinants of health, are often neglected in favour of addressing immediate biological threats with technical fixes. But what if policy-makers and practitioners could gain prior insight into the intended and unintended consequences of decision-making? What if they could test out innovative ideas in a safe environment? What if they could practice applying gender-based analysis?",

For example, if an action is deemed likely to succeed, a roll of four or higher on two dice might be required; if it was unlikely to succeed, a nine or higher might be required. The outcomes of (un) successful actions influence the development of the scenario.

It was noted that while players included GBA+ in their internal team discussions, it was rarely prioritized when it came to proposing actions. A survey respondent noted, \u2018As usual, when we want to act quickly on an issue, we often think the GBA+ consideration is less important, which results in bad planning.\u2019 Others noted that they did not emphasize GBA+ because they felt it made cooperation with other actors more difficult.",

Survey responses and participant reflections indicate the exercise met, to varying degrees, the objectives set out by GAC/DND to assess the utility of (matrix) games as a foreign policy learning tool; encourage critical thinking about preparedness; and promote the application of GBA+. In particular, by promoting internalized learning around how neglecting the social determinants of health, such as gender inequities, limit effectiveness, serious games have the potential to promote more transformative global health responses.",

First, the co-operative element of the game created a particular challenge, with post-game reflections focusing on navigating tensions between individual, often competing, interests and the need to collaborate, often with the private sector, in order to mobilize an effective global health response. Participants identified a shift in incentives to cooperate as the game progressed from preparedness to crisis response, and how this impacted the success of their actions. This outcome suggests the need for global health actors to explore ways to translate these during-crisis incentives for cooperation into pre-crisis preparedness.",

Participants experienced the barriers to prioritizing social over technical responses, implementing GBA+ and the consequences of failing to do so. Global health organizations and governments need to not only provide resources, but also engage staff in opportunities to apply gender-based analysis and internalize learning.",

Serious games can take many forms, depending on the particular questions and objectives that inform game design. For instance, the scenario in this game design made an outbreak inevitable; it therefore did not allow much opportunity for consideration of prevention, beyond those measures related to preparedness. Matrix games could be employed to tackle the question of prevention, for instance, through a scenario with multiple rounds of actions on prevention and where in the final round the adjudication would determine the likelihood of an outbreak. There are countless additional ways games could be adapted to varying global health challenges.",

Due to their flexibility, adaptability and accessibility, serious games offer a potentially powerful tool to promote innovation and learning amongst global health practitioners and policymakers. However, there is only a very limited literature on the use of serious games in general and none, to our knowledge, on their application to global health.
