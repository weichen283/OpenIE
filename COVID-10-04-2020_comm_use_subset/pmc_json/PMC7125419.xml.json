Originally, infection prevention and control and transmission were grouped separately. However, they were combined as most of the papers in the \u201ctransmission\u201d category were concerned with transmission to hospital workers. Of note, only 16% of SARS articles were published before the end of the outbreak. Table 2 defines the key clinical research questions identified from each theme. This table was modelled after a publication describing harmonisation of Zika virus protocols [6]. Themes appear in order based on how many SARS and MERS articles attempted to address a question within that theme.",

They report that the novel coronavirus presentation resembles that of SARS: a viral pneumonia with fever, cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue. They also found a high concentration of cytokines in critically ill patients, compared to less severe cases [7]. Chen, Wang, and Kui et al. reported data for 99, 138, and 137 patients respectively. All reported similar symptoms to the Huang article: fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Lymphocytopenia reported among all authors [8-10]. Chen et al. and Wang et al. also reported elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels in many patients. Wang et al. report that median hospital stay was 10 days for those discharged alive. Unlike SARS and MERS, there seems to be less presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Finally, radiological studies attempted to characterise the course of disease in chest imaging. Pan et al. report peak lung involvement at 10 days on CT studies [13]. Of note is a case series by Xie et al. that reported ground glass opacity in five patients with initial negative RT-PCR findings but suspected COVID-19. They were later confirmed to be infected [14]. Overall, clinical characterisation studies commonly found bilateral involvement with ground glass opacity, though a range of presentations were reported [8-10,15].",

Asymptomatic patients were also found to have nasopharyngeal viral loads similar to symptomatic patients [23]. Additionally, Y. Zhang et al. found live virus in stool samples [24]. Zhou and colleagues have reported positive virus results from both oral swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage samples, while bronchoalveolar lavage samples yielded higher viral copies [25]. W. Zhang et al. report the presence of viral load in oral swabs, anal swabs, and blood, suggesting respiratory, fecal-oral, and blood transmission[26]. To et al. report serial saliva samples among 12 patients, with declining viral RNA levels after hospitalization. However, one patient showed viral shedding in saliva up to 11 days [27].",

Both MERS and SARS viruses showed nosocomial transmission amplification in the health care setting [46]. During the SARS epidemic, 21% of the infected patients were health care workers, and in some countries, this rate was as high as 50% [47]. Risk of SARS infection was associated with inconsistent use of personal protective equipment, and less than 2 hours of infection control training [48]. During the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak, 44% of the 186 cases were patients that had been exposed to nosocomial transmission in hospitals, and 83% of total transmission events were due to five super spreading events in hospitals [49]. The recently released WHO protocol for evaluating risks to health care workers should be implemented as soon as possible to prevent future health care worker infections.",

As in any outbreak setting, priorities of local clinicians and public health authorities should be considered, especially in countries that integrate traditional medicine with Western medicine. Researchers may consider adopting a tiered approach as ISARIC has with the Clinical Characterisation protocols. The tiered approach allows sites to determine how much data or samples they can collect given their (limited) resources. This allows health care centres in low and middle-income countries to be represented in the data. Global solidarity is needed in the clinical research community as we may face the next pandemic of the 21st century. We all benefit from the data collected and shared. WHO have launched a clinical data collection platform for COVID-19 via the International Health Regulations and hope that member states will share their data. This uses an ISARIC WHO co-created CRF for COVID 19.",

Many of the identified gaps, such as viral pathogenesis, clinical characterisation, infection prevention, and candidate therapeutics overlap with gaps identified the WHO\u2019s R&D Blueprint research roadmap. If health care facilities around the world collect standardised patient data and quickly share it, it is likely that these core clinical research questions can be answered in real-time to inform clinical practices for COVID-19.",
