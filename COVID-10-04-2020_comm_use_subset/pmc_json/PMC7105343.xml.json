M and E may help host cells to induce the production of protective IFN-\u03b1 to fight against the virus. Bananin 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol acts as zinc (Zn2+) chelator and is therefore of interest to target and inhibit immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) zinc finger HIV-1 RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein p7 (NCp7). Bananin is converted to bananin 5\u2019-monophosphate (BNP) which together with B6RA (vitamin A-vitamin B6 conjugate) and could inhibit infectious virion encapsidation. Targets of BNP and B6RA has shown to be present also in SARS-associated coronavirus making them possible therapeutic candidates [11].",

            "text": "In general, there appeared to be a few positive results for the use of corticosteroids in viral infections such as SARS-CoV [14-19]. Corticosteroids were widely used during the SARS-CoV outbreak due to their known ability to modulate a variety of involved cytokines (including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNF\u03b1) [14, 16]. Various studies in humans noted that corticosteroids appeared effective in reducing immunopathological damage but concerns centred around the promotion of viral rebound and association with adverse events (including acute respiratory distress syndrome) [14]. One laboratory study which treated porcine respiratory coronavirus infected pigs with dexamethasone suggested that one or two doses of the corticosteroid in the acute phase of infection may effectively alleviate early pro-inflammatory response, but prolonged administration may play a role in enhancing viral replication [18]. A separate Chinese study, which separated SARS-CoV patients into 4 treatment groups, identified early high-dose steroids in combination with a quinolone as producing the best patient outcomes [19]. Nevertheless, one review stated that the WHO does not currently recommend corticosteroids in other viral diseases such as Dengue as the \u2018glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis can also drive lymphocytopenia, or it may promote exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses that eventually cause a worsening of the pathogenic condition\u2019 [20].",

One study suggested the use of Baricitinib to reduce the viral entry and inflammation caused by 2019-nCoV. Most viruses enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. ACE2, a cell-surface protein expressed on cells in the kidney, blood vessels, heart, and alveola type 2 (AT2) cells in the pulmonary epithelia, may be the receptor that 2019-nCoV uses to infect lung cells.

Genome-wide SARS-CoV yeast-two-hybrid interaction screen with human cDNA libraries identified FK506-binding proteins as interaction partners of SARS-CoV non-structural protein 1. Subsequently, the authors investigated whether tacrolimus inhibits viral replication of human coronaviruses. VeroFM cells infected with SARS-CoV and other human coronaviruses were treated with FK506. Results showed that FK506 effectively inhibited viral replication of SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E at non-toxic, low-micromolar concentrations with a reduction in viral titers to undetectable levels. The second study further confirmed this inhibition using novel non-immunosuppressive derivatives of FK506 in the context of HCoV-NL63 at low-micromolar, non-cytotoxic concentrations in cell culture [62].",
