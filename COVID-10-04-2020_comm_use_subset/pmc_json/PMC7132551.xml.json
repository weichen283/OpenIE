As of February 23, 2020, 77,041 confirmed cases have been reported in China, with a cumulative death toll of 2445. As a newly identified member of the coronavirus-beta subfamily, the virus shares more than 85% homology with the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45), belonging to the same class as the SARS-CoV found in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) found in 2012. Whole-genome sequencing and genetic analysis of the strain has demonstrated that the virus is a different branch from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [1]. Currently, the epidemic that originated in Wuhan is ongoing. On February 11, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Virus (ICTV) officially named 2019-nCoV as \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d (SARS-CoV-2) [2]. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has named the disease caused by infection with this virus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Generally, the incubation period of COVID-19 ranges from 1 to 14 days, with most people developing symptoms between 3\u20137 days; however, the longest incubation period can reach 24 days [3]. The clinical severity of COVID-19 varies greatly, from asymptomatic to death.",

The assay has high specificity, but low sensitivity. Hence, chest CT has become a critical diagnostic tool for COVID-19, used in close combination with clinical manifestations and epidemiological evidence for disease confirmation. However, discrepancies between the results of NAT and imaging features have been reported in the literature. For example, the CT images of some patients showed apparent lesions in the lungs, yet NAT repeatedly showed negative results until eventually turning positive [4]. Recently, Fang et al. observed that in diagnosing COVID-19, the sensitivity of CT (98%) was significantly higher than that of RT-PCR (71%) [5]. China\u2019s Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia (5th Trial Edition) has established CT imaging as the clinical diagnosis in Hubei Province. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further studies to provide data and evidence on the manifestations of COVID-19 in chest CT imaging.",

The scan covered the area from the thoracic inlet to the costophrenic angle. As patients with relatively severe symptoms found it difficult to hold their breath, the scan was performed in a reverse direction from the costophrenic angle to the thoracic inlet. The lung window was reconstructed with a high-resolution algorithm at 1.0 mm. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed using post-processing workstations. The machine and the room were thoroughly disinfected after the examination of each patient.",

The lesions were not confined to certain segments of lung lobes, possibly due to the small size of the virions that tend to deposit on the lobules in the periphery of the lung, thereby causing damage to the alveolar epithelium and affecting multiple adjacent lobules [10].",

This can be explained by the virus-induced diffuse alveolar wall injury, vascular congestion, and alveolar septal inflammation [11]. (2) Increased lesion density, along with disease progression manifested as patchy consolidations, was detected in 91 cases (69%). These pathological changes could be attributed to alveolar wall collapse, causing the replacement of alveoli by exudates or products of other diseases (such as cells and epithelium) [12]. Recently, the autopsy of the first COVID-19 patient who died in China revealed significant shedding of the alveolar epithelium and the formation of the pulmonary hyaline membrane [13], consistent with the clinical symptoms of COVID-19, i.e. cough without substantial sputum. (3) Mixed lesions of ground-glass opacities and consolidations was observed in 79 patients (61%), with or without nodule. Diffused, bilateral pulmonary lesions similar to \u201cwhite lungs\u201d was observed in 10 patients. In these cases, consolidations constituted most of the lesions, with a small percentage demonstrating complicated pulmonary fibrotic foci, which might be related to the fact that the lesions were in the repairing phase [14].",

It\u2019s difficult to distinguish the imaging from COVID-19, but pleural effusion and pneumothorax are more common in died patients cause by MERS [22]. (3) Early manifestation of influenza virus is primarily tracheobronchitis which presented as nodules or patchy shadows around the bronchial. Centrilobular nodules, pneumatocele formation and lymphadenopathy are often seen in influenza A [23]. To some extent, combined with epidemiology and chest CT can distinguish COVID-19 from other viruses. (4) For mycoplasma pneumonia, the major manifestations include reduced light transmittance of the lung lobes, thickened vascular, thickened bronchial walls, and visible peripheral nodules, presenting the \u201ctree-in-bud\u201d pattern. The disease is commonly complicated by pleural effusion and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes [24]. (5) Bacterial pneumonia is often community-acquired or hospital-acquired, with increased WBCs and neutrophils and imaging often showing patchy, nodular, or consolidation shadows distributed along the bronchi or lung segments, which can be distinctly recognized [25].
