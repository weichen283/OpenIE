Usually, molecular docking takes a few seconds to minutes on modern CPUs considering only the flexibility of small molecules and keeping the protein rigid. Thus, virtual screening against a target consumes a great amount of computational resources that only supercomputers can provide. Next, thousands of compounds with the best docking scores are kept for structural clustering. Within the clustered compound list, about 100 candidate compounds are finally selected for subsequent validation. The criteria for manual selection are drug-like properties and binding modes generated by molecular docking. To validate the potency of these candidate compounds, various methods are employed, including enzymatic activity assays, enzymatic binding assays, enzymatic selectivity assays, structure\u2013activity relationship studies, and cell assays. Recent successful applications of virtual screening in our lab are briefly introduced below.",

Most of the existing DNMT inhibitors are nucleoside analogues that can cause toxic side effects. Through a combination of docking-based screening and biochemical assays, a novel non-nucleoside DNMT1 inhibitor named DC_05 was identified, which inhibits DNMT1 at low micromolar concentrations and has remarkable selectivity against other similar methyltransferases.

Aberrant PRC2 activity has been broadly implicated in cancer initiation and progression, making it a promising target for cancer therapy.

Frequently, prophylaxis of MRSA infection with antibiotics fails or leads to nosocomial diseases such as Clostridium difficile infection, due to drug resistance. Sortase A is a transpeptidase that anchors surface proteins in the envelope of S. aureus, and mutant sortases are unable to cause bacteraemia or sepsis in mice. Through virtual screening and structural optimization, a series of inhibitors were identified that blocked the activity of sortase in vitro and in vivo. These inhibitors protected mice against lethal S. aureus bacteraemia without affecting staphylococcal growth in vitro. Thus, these sortase inhibitors may act as an anti-infection therapy to protect high-risk patients from hospital-acquired S. aureus infection, without incurring the side effects of antibiotics [11].",

Sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2), one of the isoenzymes that produce S1P, is associated with histone H3 and regulates histone acetylation via S1P, which specifically binds to the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 to inhibit their enzymatic activity [16]. On the other side, FTY720 (fingolimod), an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, has beneficial effects in the central nervous system that are independent of its effects on immune cell trafficking, although the mechanism is not currently well understood. FTY720 is phosphorylated by SPHK2 in the nucleus, after which it binds and inhibits HDACs, enhancing specific histone acetylation. Having identified the possible binding mode of FTY720 within the pocket of HDAC via molecular docking, as shown in Fig. 3, it was concluded that FTY720 may be a useful adjuvant therapy to facilitate the extinction of aversive memories by targeting HDACs [17].",

This library currently contains 533 drug targets and 179 807 active ligands, of which each target has its own ligand set. Based on the large reference library, the similarity fusion scores between a query molecule and each ligand set were calculated as the corresponding target scores of this molecule, using the Tanimoto coefficient [24] of ECFP4 fingerprints [25]. Finally, the top targets ranked by fusion scores were considered as the potential targets of the query. A 10-fold cross validation was adopted to evaluate the performance of the similarity fusion schemes or KNN fusion. Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) [26], a statistics-based chemoinformatics approach, was also tested in parallel with our fusion schemes for comparison. It was demonstrated that KNN fusion performed better than SEA on a reference set and that 3NN outperformed the most. The target prediction accuracy of the 3NN fusion strategy would be improved with the increasing size of the reference set, which shows that the strategy could be applied to better deal with the problem of big data on active ligands. On the two external test sets compiled from DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database, the 3NN scheme also exhibited its greater accuracy on the top 20 predictions. Another point of note is that this method could successfully predict 62 of 65 new drug targets identified by SEA.",

However, in the simulation of the KCNQ2 channel, another member of Kv channels and an anti-epilepsy target, a cavity filled with water molecules appeared in the VSD (Fig. 4B). As the volume of this space is \u223c170 \u00c53, we guessed that a potential-binding pocket was located in the KCNQ2 VSD. Based on the docking model of ztz240 (a KCNQ2 activator reported previously [59]) to the KCNQ2 homology model, one MD simulation on the ztz240/KCNQ2 complex was conducted by using GROMACS 4.5.4 package [50], which provided a structural binding model for ztz240. Further mutagenesis and electrophysiological studies validated this activator-binding pocket in the VSD of KCNQ2 [60] (Fig. 4B). Subsequent structure-based virtual screening targeting the identified pocket discovered nine activators with five new chemotypes, two of which exhibited significant anti-epilepsy activity [60] (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate the capability of the KCNQ2 VSD to accommodate small chemical ligands. The new functionality of the gating charge pathway offers new insights into the therapeutically relevant KCNQ2 channel.",

PIP2 is a phospholipid component that is enriched at the plasma membrane, and a substrate for a number of important signalling proteins including the Kv channels [61\u201364]. Though PIP2 alters the physiological function and pharmacological selectivity of KCNQ channels [65\u201367], the effects and interactions of PIP2 on KCNQ channels are not well understood. To predict the interactions of PIP2 with the KCNQ2 channel, 200 ns all-atom MD simulations on both the open and closed conformations of the KCNQ2 channel were performed using GROMACS 4.6.1 package [50,68]. Simulations with two different force fields yielded similar PIP2 interactions: PIP2 preferentially interacted with K230 in the S4\u2013S5 linker of the open-state KCNQ2 channel, whereas it contacted K160 and other positive residues in the S2\u2013S3 loop of the closed state (Fig. 4C). These interactions were different from the PIP2\u2013Shaker and PIP2\u2013Kv1.2 interactions [69]. Consistently, the effects of PIP2 on KCNQ2 were also different relative to the Shaker and Kv1.2 channels. The results indicate the diversity of PIP2 effects on Kv channels. The mechanism we proposed for the action of PIP2 on the KCNQ2 channel is consistent with the reported subtype sensitivity of PIP2 to Kv channels [70,71] and indicates that PIP2 may exert specific effects on KCNQ1 channels [68]. Thus, MD simulation is an effective method with which to analyse protein\u2013lipid interaction.",

Because \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR are subtypes specifically compartmentalized on cholesterol-enriched caveolae or lipid rafts, two 8 \u03bcs MD simulations of \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR embedded in a 2:1 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol mixture membrane were performed using the GROMACS 4.5.3 package [50] to compare the potential cholesterol-binding sites for \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR. Big differences were observed in the cholesterol interaction sites between \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR, which are relevant to cholesterol-mediated dimerisation and the allosteric regulation of receptor activity [78].

MD simulation has emerged as a practical approach for exploring protein dynamics but is still unequal as a generally applicable strategy to explore large-scale protein conformational transitions. Considering the structure of the new generation supercomputer, we developed a new approach, called NUMD, to deal with large-scale protein conformational movement, which is a combination of normal mode analysis and umbrella sampling MD simulation. This new approach can produce thousands of the protein conformations along the conformational transition pathway, and each conformation can be simulated simultaneously with thousands of CPUs. Therefore, compared with other widely used MD approaches including NAMD, GROMACS, and AMBER, the new code is specifically suitable for HPC to delineate atomically detailed conformational transition pathways and the associated free energy landscapes. Its application on three well-known protein systems (adenylate kinase (AdK), calmodulin (CaM), and p38\u03b1 kinase) in the absence and presence of their respective ligands revealed that the predicted conformational transition pathway and thermodynamic observables were in good agreement with experimentally and computationally determined ones (Fig. 5). Thus, this simple approach offers a generally applicable strategy by using HPC for probe intrinsic or ligand-induced large-scale protein conformational transitions and the associated free energy landscape [79,80].",

The correctly folded protein structure or conformation is essential to the protein's biological function. A failure to fold into the native structure may produce inactive proteins, but misfolded proteins may also have modified or toxic functionality. For example, aggregated proteins are associated with illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease. MD simulation is a good tool for the study of protein folding and dynamics in silico. AD is a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. Two pathologically characterized hallmarks of AD are the appearance of extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles [81,82]. The major constituents of the plaques are amyloid \u03b2-peptides (A\u03b2) of 39\u201343 amino acids, which are produced by the sequential action of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases on the amyloid precursor protein [83]. A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 are the two most abundant A\u03b2 isoforms, with the only difference found at their C-termini, where the latter has two more hydrophobic residues. It has been demonstrated that A\u03b242 is more neurotoxic than A\u03b240, and that an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 concentration ratio correlates with the onset of AD [84,85].",

Structures with few short \u03b2-sheets and helices were identified as intermediate states in the unfolding pathway of A\u03b240 (Fig. 6). Four tandem glycines (G25, G29, G33, and G37) at the C-terminal of A\u03b240 were found to account for the short \u03b2-sheet formation. Further mutation of these glycines to alanines almost abolished the \u03b2-sheet formation and increased the content of the helix component instead (Fig. 6). In the lipid bilayer of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, the major secondary structure of A\u03b240 is helical; however, the peptide tends to exit from the hydrophobic region and lie down on the surface of the bilayer. Overall, these results provide an annotation of conformational transition in relation to the dynamic process of A\u03b2 exiting from the membrane and entering into aqueous solution. It is beneficial to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of A\u03b2 aggregation and design compounds that can inhibit the formation of oligomers as well as amyloid fibrils (Fig. 6).",

Chemical compounds that lock the structure of A\u03b2 into the \u03b1-helix/\u03b2-sheet intermediate state could possibly inhibit A\u03b2 fibrillation. Targeting this intermediate structure, a virtual screening based on molecular docking was performed with the goal of discovering small molecule inhibitors that interrupt the formation of the pleated \u03b2-sheet structures involved in amyloid fibrils via binding to the intermediate structure [91]. One of the docked compounds, DC-AB1, was shown to effectively inhibit the aggregation and fibrillation of A\u03b2 by thioflavin T fluorescence assay, atomic force microscopy, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Meanwhile, CD spectroscopy measurement revealed that the \u03b2-sheet component of A\u03b2 increased in the presence of DC-AB1, suggesting that the binding of DC-AB1 to A\u03b2 stabilized the \u03b2-sheet structure of the peptide. Taken together, our study not only demonstrated that the \u03b1-helix/\u03b2-sheet intermediate structures revealed by the aforementioned simulations could be used as a binding target for inhibitor design, but also provided new insights into the molecular events involved in the conformational transition of A\u03b2 peptides in fibrillogenesis.",

In a recent study, we set out to investigate the conformation dynamics of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 by exploring the impact of intramolecular interactions on conformation dynamics using equilibrium MD simulations [93]. Our 40 \u03bcs-scale simulations revealed heterogeneous conformation ensembles of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 that encompassed \u223c35% \u03b2-strand and \u223c60% unstructured coils. Two conformational states were identified in both isoforms: a collapsed state (CS) that resembles the structural motif of face-to-face hydrophobic clustering in amyloid fibrils, and an extended state (ES) that carries the structural feature of anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets observed in amyloid oligomers. This observation is in line with previous NMR studies. In A\u03b240, the C-terminus remains unstructured and rarely interacts with other parts, therefore, the hydrophobic clustering is loosely structured and the peptide assumes an ES with high probability. In contrast, the C-terminus of A\u03b242 adopts a \u03b2-strand structure that strongly interacts with segments E3-R5 and V18-A21. The active associations of this extra \u03b2-strand lead to a more compact hydrophobic collapse and prevent the isoform from forming the ES. Based on our structural characterization, we propose that the aggregation begins in the CS, and that the propensity of the various isoforms to self-associate into a particular form is encoded in their equilibrium conformational states. As our simulation results demonstrate that the probability of A\u03b242 staying in CS is significantly higher than that of A\u03b240, the enhanced aggregation propensity of the former could result from the consequent lowered energy barrier for nucleate formation. Besides, a greater resemblance to fibril structure is observed in the CS of A\u03b242, including increased occupancy of the \u03b2-strand at V18-A21 and I31-M35 and compact hydrophobic collapse. These structural advantages could also contribute to the effectiveness of nucleation.",
