The causative agent soon proved to be a new betacoronavirus related to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease has been named \u201cCOVID-19\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO) and on January 30, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO Director-General [2]. Despite the lockdown of Wuhan and the suspension of all public transport, flights and trains on January 23, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases, including 6,484 (16.1%) with severe illness, and 909 deaths (2.2%) had been reported in China by the National Health Commission up to February 10, 2020; meanwhile, 319 cases and one death were reported outside of China, in 24 countries [3].",

Preliminary data suggest that older males with comorbidities may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 [6, 8, 9].

Also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19, which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [21] had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people. The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial; these cases, which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 infections, remain unrecognized, especially during the influenza season [22]. This highly likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context, distorting epidemiologic reality.",
