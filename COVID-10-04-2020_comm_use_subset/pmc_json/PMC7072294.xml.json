            "text": "Before the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012, we built a model using artificial intelligence (AI) tools for the identification of the levels of predicted intrinsic disorder (PID) in a query protein using its amino acid sequence as the only input [1]. Next, this information was applied to rank various coronaviruses based on the levels of disorder in their inner and outer shells (i.e., PID values evaluated for their nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, respectively) and to find if these shell PID values were indicative of how long the given virus was able to stay in the environment [1,2,3]. The application of this model ranked coronaviruses into three groups (Categories A, B, and C), members of which differ not only by the levels of their shell disorder, but also by their respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potential [1,2,3]. The model was consistent with the hypothesis that viruses remaining in harsh environments require harder, i.e., less disordered, shells to survive [2,3]. Furthermore, higher levels of inner shell disorder could be associated with greater infectivity, especially with regard to the viruses with high respiratory transmission potential [3,4,5]. ",

Notably, some (not all) of the viruses with lower outer shell rigidity (higher M PID) are in Category C with greater fecal-oral transmission potential because these viruses do not have to be in the environment for a long time given that the fecal-oral route is an efficient mode of transmission among some farm animals.",

The possibility of fecal-respiratory transmission of COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV is especially of concern, as was the case for SARS-CoV in the Amoy Garden, Hong Kong3.

These properties can also explain the higher contagiousness levels of the COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV than with SARS-CoV [6]. In fact, the ability of COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV to remain infectious outside the body for a longer period than SARS-CoV could imply that it requires fewer viral particles for greater chances of infection. Furthermore, an infected body can shed more active viral particles in greater concentrations as more particles are able to resist the digestive enzymes found in most bodily fluids including saliva [2,3]. All these can explain not only high contagiousness of the COVID-19/Wuhan 2019-nCoV but also the reported capability of this virus to be spread even before the patient begins to show symptoms [6].",
