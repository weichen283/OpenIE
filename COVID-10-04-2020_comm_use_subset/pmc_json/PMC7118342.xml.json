Furthermore, knowledge of the status of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCW would provide important insights for the participating hospitals regarding the infection status of staff and would inform hospital policies on testing algorithms for their personnel and on infection prevention measures.",

Two hospitals indicated that they had already started systematic sampling of HCW as part of their hospital policy. Four hospitals had no systematic sampling policy for HCW but were testing all patients that presented at the emergency ward with respiratory complaints. In addition, two hospitals just outside Noord-Brabant with a large proportion of staff residing in the affected province participated in the assessment (Figure). The participating hospitals were asked to offer screening to HCW and share the results of the testing by 14:00 on Monday 9 March 2020. Upper respiratory tract specimens (throat and/or nasopharyngeal swab) were collected from HCW with mild respiratory complaints and without epidemiological link. Testing followed a uniform national protocol based on Corman et al. [3], that was rolled out by two central laboratories in the Netherlands. The testing was done either locally or in one of these two central laboratories. ",

The study supported the implemented mitigation policy that was advised by the OMT on 6 March in anticipation of the results of the assessment [7]. The additional measures undertaken by regional authorities involved requesting inhabitants of Noord-Brabant to practice self-isolation at home when they developed a cough, symptoms of common cold and/or a fever. Furthermore, a ban of public events involving more than 1,000 people was implemented in this province [8]. As the epidemiological situation developed, on 12 March 2020, self-isolation upon mild respiratory symptoms was implemented for the whole country, together with a ban of events with more than 100 people [9].

Nevertheless, data provided by the World Health Organization-China joint mission on COVID-19, support our approach. The mission report indicated that there were 2,055 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 among HCW from 476 hospitals in China. Close investigation into these cases revealed that most of them could be traced back to exposure in households rather than in a healthcare setting [10].",
