Furthermore, we generated two deletion constructs of SE (SE5, SE6) that span the overlaps of SE2 and SE3 (Fig. 3a) to identify the antigenic epitope.

Based on the information of other coronaviruses, we found that the S1 domain is thought to contain multiple virus neutralization epitopes and receptor binding-domains [22]. The S2 domain forms the trans-membrane structure of the S protein, but can not induce neutralizing antibodies [23]. These properties make it possible that the S1 could be a suitable candidate for screening and identifying antigenic epitopes. Epitopes are important antigenic elements of virus structural proteins, which could induce antibody production and cell-mediated immunity against viruses.

Twenty-four hours later, cells were fixed and incubated with SE polyclonal antisera or normal mouse serum (negative control), and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H + L) antibody.
