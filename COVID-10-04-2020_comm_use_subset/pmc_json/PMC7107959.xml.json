We need to have a vaccination for influenza each year because each vaccine can only target one virus subtype or virus strain.

For example, the H1N1 and H3N2 vaccines are currently being used to prevent influenza, but the vaccine suitable for the mutated virus next season needs to be developed. Such vaccine development requires large investment and has a very high risk. Thus, research and development of Ebola vaccine belongs to the realm of public health.

They also showed that WIV1 binds to the SARS-CoV receptor, thus providing direct evidence that bat-to-human transmission is plausible. K. Y. Yuen of Hong Kong University has also discovered many viruses in bats (named HKU1, HKU2\u2026) and we, in collaboration with K. Y. Yuen showed that HKU4 can use the receptor for the newly emerged Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus to enter human cells, although the efficiency is low. This represents another example of bat-originated respiratory syndrome viruses.

Many newly emerged infectious diseases involve infection in both humans and animals, but some viruses affect humans but not animals, why? Understanding whether and how a virus affecting one species become infectious in another species is critical in developing effective preventive measures. Our understanding of molecular mechanisms via research on influenza virus over the years greatly helped the analysis of the viral infection mechanism when avian flu epidemic appeared.",

One of our goals is to solve the problem of cross-species transmission through multidisciplinary approaches. Regarding virus propagation by migratory birds, for example, zoologists may examine the migratory behaviors of birds, virologists and molecular biologists can study the mechanism of infection of avian viruses on human cells, and China CDC, which has established a national network of infectious diseases monitoring networks throughout China since the SARS pandemic, can provide immediate information on disease incidence in various local regions. Integrating multiple resources of information will allow us to understand the nature of the virus, and whether and how it spread cross species.",

My point is that the process of gene mutation and natural selection involves many more combinatorial scenarios than the human mind can imagine, and how could one select among all possibilities and provide comprehensive tests? I think a more direct and effective approach is to strengthen the capability of monitoring disease-causing viruses and finding solutions to curtail their spread. For example, we have monitored H5- and H9-type influenza viruses over a long period; when similar infectious diseases appear, we can rely upon existing methods and platforms to analyze the virus and propose a solution. During the H7N9 avian flu epidemic in 2013, we were able to identify the problem and",
