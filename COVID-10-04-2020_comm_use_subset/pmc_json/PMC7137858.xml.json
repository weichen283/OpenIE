The international scientific literature on the use of this application in the health sector, identified by the major database, on-line, reports only a small number of publications. Although its impact in the clinical setting has been poorly investigated, WhatsApp is among the most widely used communication tools, which may also be valuable in favoring the communication and relationship between patients and physicians. Healthcare providers should be trained to use modern web-based communication systems with accurate assessment of indications and contraindications [3, 4].",
