Renin is a protease that cleaves angiotensinogen, the precursor of angiotensin, which is made by the liver; it produces an inactive peptide, angiotensin I (AngI). ACE then mediates the conversion of AngI to AngII, a major RAS effector. ACE is a protein that is highly expressed on membranes of vascular endothelial cells, predominantly in lung tissue.3 Most RAS-associated physiologic effects are driven by the interaction of AngII with a G-protein coupled AngII type 1 (AT1) receptor. This activates a physiologic pathway in different systems: kidney, liver, central nervous system, respiratory system, and/or cardiovascular system. Some crucial events are regulated via active AT1 receptors including arterial pressure, fluid and sodium balance, fibrosis, and cellular growth and migration.2\n",
