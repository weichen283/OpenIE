Among various kinds of disasters, epidemic disease outbreaks may pose tremendous treats for human beings [2,3], and it may, if ineffectively controlled, further become a pandemic and lead to a global crisis. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO), an epidemic outbreak is \u201cthe occurrence of disease cases in excess of normal expectancy\u201d [4], which is usually caused by an infectious disease through human-to-human transmission and animal-to-human transmission or by the exposure to radioactive and hazardous chemical sources [4]. During the latest two decades, the outbreak of several infectious and deadly diseases, i.e., the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Marburg hemorrhagic fever in 2007, the H1N1 influenza in 2009, the Ebola virus in 2014, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) in 2014, have not only caused a large number of deaths, but also severely affected the economic development of these countries. Moreover, the fear of epidemic spread has led to a global panic. ",

In this regard, the establishment of an effective and responsive logistics network to deal with this temporarily and drastically increased demand is of essential importance. Over the years, optimization models and methods have been formulated in order to investigate the logistics problems and to improve the decision-makings for preparation of and quick response to the outbreak of infectious diseases [5]. However, another significant challenge, which is the reverse logistics system for effective management of medical waste, has never been thoroughly investigated. The medical waste generation increases exponentially in epidemic outbreak and it may, if improperly collected or treated, accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk on both medical staffs and patients. Due to this reason, the proper design of a temporary reverse logistics system for effective management of the dramatically increased medical waste and healthcare hazards in epidemic outbreak is of paramount significance.

            "text": "Since December 2019, several cases of atypical pneumonia caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in Wuhan, China [6,7], which has later been confirmed to be due to human-to-human transmission [8]. Since January 2020, the number of COVID-19 infections has increased significantly and a global emergency has been declared by the WHO on January 31th [9]. The total reported infections by February 25th (08:30 h Norway time) had increased to 79,331 in at least 30 countries [10], among which more than 97% are reported in mainland China [10]. The total death toll has reached to more than 2600 [10], which surpasses by three times the total number of deaths during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [11]. In order to control the rapid spread of the COVID-19, the epidemic center, Wuhan, a city with more than 10 million residents, was placed on effective lockdown on January 23th and the lockdown measures were shortly after implemented in the whole of Hubei Province [12]. The number of city lockdowns in China had increased to more than 80 by the beginning of February. Besides, tourist sites were closed across the country, public gatherings were cancelled and people was encouraged to stay at home [13]. All school activities were suspended [13]. and instead, online platforms have been used for teaching and learning. The implementation of lockdown policies has effectively restricted both inbound and outbound transportation in Hubei Province [6], and the mobility of people within the cities has been largely reduced [13]. In Wuhan, within two weeks, several temporary hospitals have been established to provide more clinical beds and medical service for the COVID-19 infection. This has led to significant logistics challenges in both forward and reverse directions. From the reverse logistics perspective, the rapidly increased amount of medical waste due to the COVID-19 outbreak needs to be collected and treated in a timely, safe and effective manner in order to minimize the virus spread and the risk to humans. Taking into account the real-world challenge faced in Wuhan, a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer linear program is modeled for the reverse logistics network design of medical waste management in epidemic outbreak, which aims at improving the decision-makings related to the temporary facilities and the transportation planning. Meanwhile, the model could provide quantitative analysis and managerial insights into the system performance.",

Taking into account the dynamics of infections and demands, Liu and Zhao [18] formulated an optimization model to determine the replenishment strategy and the allocation plan of emergency reliefs under bioterrorism situations. Liu and Liang [19] proposed a dynamic linear program to minimize the overall cost of a three-level emergency logistics system for the allocation of medical reliefs in disease outbreak. Considering both epidemic spread dynamics and stochastic incubation period, Wang, et al. [20] developed a bi-objective stochastic model to simultaneously improve the responsiveness and the cost effectiveness of emergency resource distribution.

Over the last two decades, quantitative optimization models and computational methods have been extensively investigated in order to improve the decision-making on reverse logistics network design at both strategic and operational levels [22,24]. With the implementation of different techniques, these decision-support models focused mainly on the optimization of economic efficiency [25,26,27,28], environmental impact [23,28,29,30], potential job creation as well as other socio-economic impact factors [31]. The effectiveness of these optimization models and computational methods have been validated in a large variety of industries and business sectors [32,33,34,35].",

Budak and Ustundag [38] proposed a single-objective mixed integer program for making the optimal location-allocation decisions related to collection, transportation and disposal of medical waste in Turkey. The primary objective of the model is to minimize the total cost. Mantzaras and Voudrias [39] developed a nonlinear integer program for the location-routing problem to minimize the overall cost for the medical waste reverse logistics network design in a Greek region. However, the problems in these studies were mainly modeled as general reverse logistics systems. The risk and environmental impact of medical waste treatment were not taken into consideration. To tackle this problem, He et al. [40] investigated the material flow and the structure of medical waste collection systems in China in order to minimize the risk of reverse logistics operations. Thakur and Anbanandam [41] studied the barriers of medical waste reverse logistics in India with a fuzzy-matrice d\u2019impacts crois\u00e9s multiplication appliqu\u00e9e \u00e1 un classement (MICMAC) analysis. Wang, et al.

The two objective functions were combined with a weighted sum and the model was validated with a real-world case study in Shanghai, China.",

However, to our knowledge, no research work has been conducted to design a temporary reverse logistics system for the treatment of rapidly increased medical waste and healthcare hazards in epidemic outbreak, which, if inappropriately managed, may pose a significant risk.

The composition of medical waste may include infectious waste, sharp object, chemical substance, pathological waste, radioactive waste, etc. [43], which may contain highly hazardous substances and may impose potential risks to medical staffs, patients and the general public [43]. The reverse logistics of medical waste comprises of three main activities: (1) collection and separation at the sources; (2) transportation to respective facilities; and (3) proper treatment and disposal [44]. At the sources, medical waste is usually collected and sorted with color-coded containers based on their characteristics, but the color selected, the waste classification and the requirement of maximum storage time in different regions are by no means identical [45]. For example, in Hubei Province, the maximum storage time of the medical waste at hospitals from the COVID-19 patients is 24 hours, while it is 48 hours for other medical waste [46]. The transportation of medical waste usually comprises of two parts, where the first part is to transport the infectious medical waste from hospitals to treatment centers and the second part is to send the residue to landfill [47]. Due to the hazardous nature, medical waste must be properly treated before the final disposal, otherwise it may has a significant environmental impact, i.e., contamination of surface and underground waters [43]. Medical waste can be treated by several methods, i.e., thermal processes, chemical processes, irradiation technologies, biological processes and mechanical processes [48], among which the incineration of medical waste is the most widely practiced method today [43]. However, the fly ash, SO2 as well as other pollutants from the incineration of medical waste may result in air pollution and an improper location of incineration plant may hence impose a significant risk on nearby residents [49].",

The problem is usually modeled as a two-stage decision-making problem where the first stage decisions select the strategic locations for different facilities and the second stage decisions determine the operations of the network in a short-term horizon. The focus is to balance the trade-off between economic performance and environmental risk related to collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste [42]. However, when an epidemic disease breaks out, the generation of infectious medical waste as well as the other healthcare hazards may be drastically increased within a very short period due to the exponentially rapid spread of the disease at the initial stage. This leads to a significant challenge for the reverse logistics system of medical waste and puts forward another complex short-term decision-making problem on how to deal with the fast accumulation of medical hazards. In this regard, Figure 1 presents the framework of a reverse logistics system for effective management of medical waste in epidemic outbreak, where, besides the existing facilities, temporary transit centers and temporary treatment centers are established in order to provide sufficient capacity to treat the increased medical waste and to effectively eliminate the infectious virus before disposal. The medical waste collected at hospitals as well as other healthcare centers can either be directly transported to the treatment centers or be transferred and consolidated via temporary transit centers. Nevertheless, a specific transportation mode may be implemented in accordance with practical situations.",

Several methods have been investigated for the quantification and assessment of risk in different fields [50,51,52]. Equation (1) presents a widely accepted approach for evaluating the risk impact [53], where the risk impact is determined by the probability and the consequences of a risk event. For implementing this risk assessment approach to a variety of projects or systems, different parameters should be defined accordingly. In this regard, both quantitative methods, i.e., AHP [54,55], TOPSIS [55], etc., and qualitative methods, i.e., Delphi method [56], expert options [57], etc., have been extensively investigated for the quantification of the probability and the consequence of risk events:(1)Risk=Probability \u00d7 Consequence ",

The first objective function Equation (2) minimizes the risk at hospitals, healthcare centers as well as other sources of medical waste, where large amounts of patients are received within a short period for medical service in epidemic outbreak. The probability of accidental risk at the sources is measured by the professional level and by the capacity of medical waste management at different hospitals and healthcare institutions. Research has revealed improper management of healthcare hazards results in severe consequence of HIV infections of medical staffs [58]. Furthermore, the risk of the spread of infectious disease increases rapidly if the healthcare hazards cannot be collected and treated in a timely and appropriate manner. For example, researches have shown the persistence of coronavirus on inanimate surfaces, i.e., medical waste, could be up to 9 days [59]. Moreover, some infectious diseases, i.e., the COVID-19, may be possible for aerosol transmission especially within closed environment like hospitals [60], which further increase the risk of disease spread. The consequence of accidental risk is proportional to the number of patients received at hospitals and healthcare institutions and to the spread rate of the epidemic disease. Therefore, for a given epidemic disease, the objective aims at minimizing the long-time storage of medial waste at the sources in order to reduce of the risk of disease spread among patients and medical staffs due to accidents:(2)Minimize f1= \u2211p\u2208P\u2211h\u2208HPbAhUQhpNpathpRI",

The first three parts evaluate the transportation risk via temporary transit centers and the last two parts calculate the risk related to direct transportation.

At the time of the case study, the outbreak of the COVID-19 was still at the developing stage and the available knowledge and information were thus extremely limited. Based on the information published by the Health Commission of Hubei Province (web: wjw.hubei.gov.cn) and the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (web: wjw.wuhan.gov.cn) until February 9th (19:30 h Norway time), the COVID-19 spread tendency in Wuhan was predicted with the SEIR method in AnyLogic simulation package. The SEIR method is based on a compartment theory and has been extensively used to predict epidemic spread [68]. The SEIR method comprises of consecutive processes connecting four fundamental population groups: the susceptible population, the exposed population, the infected population, and the recovered population [69]. The dynamics of the conversion of these four types of population is introduced by Liu et al. [14] and Liu and Zhang [16].",

In this research, a SEIR model was built up in AnyLogic. The model input was, to our best, the information collected at the time of the case study (February 9th). In addition, several assumptions were made in order to predict the future disease spread tendency in Wuhan. The initial infections were set to 41, which was the reported number until January 11th [7]. The basic reproduction rate of the COVID-19, which depicts the average number of secondary infections caused by one patient to all susceptible population throughout the whole course of its infection [14], was set to 2.68 in Wuhan [6]. The incubation period of the COVID-19 was set to 7 days [73]. The average length of stay in hospital was set to two to three weeks [74] and the probability of contact infection was assumed to be 0.4. Taking into account the fact that Wuhan has been placed on effective lockdown since January 23th, 2020, the inbound and outbound transportation has been effectively cut off and the mobility of people within the city has been drastically restricted, so the disease may only be spread within a flexible domain of susceptible population. Due to this reason, the size of susceptible population was estimated with the best fit of the real data at the time of the case study, as shown in Figure 2a. The repetition of the simulation was set to 20 times and the confidence level was set to be within 10%.",

The basic reproduction rate of the COVID-19 was used for the value of RI [6]. The probability of transportation risk is determined by the probability of traffic accident and is proportional to the transport distance. For infectious healthcare hazards, it can be quantified by PbAht=0.36\u00d7travel distance (km)\u00d710\u22126 [65]. The consequence was assumed to be proportional to the population exposure within 500 m bandwidth along the transportation route [82], which was estimated by the travel distance and the demographic distribution of Wuhan. To evaluate the risk related to facility operations, in accordance with Zhao and Huang [65], the probability of accident was assumed to be 0.0001 for transit stations and 0.0006 treatment centers. The population exposure to medical waste transit and treatment facilities was considered as the main parameter for measuring the consequence of risk event. Herein, the facility risk was estimated by PbA=\u03c0r2(km2)\u00d7Population density (people/km2) [83], where the affected radius was set to 1 km for transit stations and 3 km for treatment centers.",

Furthermore, the allocation of hospitals and the facility utilization rate are given in Table 8 and Table 9, respectively. Compared with the current plan in Wuhan, both Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals are selected to open temporary treatment centers. However, instead of Jinyingtan hospital, another two candidate locations at Wuhan Keting and Huangpi No.1 Middle School are chosen to install the temporary incinerators. Besides, the optimal solution suggests the operations of the temporary medical waste incinerator at Leishenshan hospital should be started from the second period, while the operations of the other incinerators should be started from the third period.

However, as shown in Table 8 and Table 9, the utilization rate of Guodingshang medical waste incineration plant is extremely low compared with the other temporary incinerators, which means the medical waste generated at hospitals is primary distributed to temporary incinerators instead of the existing facility. The reason of this could be explained by its location. Guodingshang medical waste incineration plant is located at Hanyang district, which is an urban district and is with high population density [78]. Therefore, as argued in a previous research [49], the operations of a medical waste incineration plant not only have negative environmental impact but also pose a significant risk on the nearby residents. The medical waste and healthcare hazards generated in epidemic outbreak are highly infectious and dangerous, the treatment of them at a centrally located incineration plant may dramatically increase the treatment risk on population exposure and is thus minimized in the optimal solution.",

On the other hand, when \u03bc2(x) decreases from 0.5 to 0.3, the optimal value of \u03bc1(x) is increased from 0.91 to 0.93 and more medical waste at the hospitals are collected and treated. Taking into account the change of satisfaction level of the cost objective, the satisfaction level \u03bc1(x) is decreased by 8.8% when \u03bc3(x) increases from 0.3 to 0.4. This reveals that, for a given satisfaction level \u03bc2(x) , a reduction on budget may lead to a higher risk at hospitals and other sources of medical waste.

In general, the minimization of the risk at sources may require a compromise on the risk related to transportation and treatment of medical waste.

However, the cost effectiveness may vary drastically in different situations.

The knowledge and information of the novel coronavirus are limited especially at the early phase of the outbreak in December 2019 [84], so the reported infections at that time may be largely variated from the real infections. In addition, due to the lack of healthcare resources and the shortage of clinical beds before the completion of those temporary hospitals in early February, a large amount of suspected infections in Wuhan cannot be diagnosed and be received in hospital in a timely way [85]. In order to provide enough clinical beds for the increased amount of the COVID-19 infections, more hospitals have been opened and more temporary mobile cabin hospitals have been planned [86].

As recently addressed by the Director-General of the WHO, \u201cwith early, aggressive measures, countries can stop transmission and save lives [88]\u201d. Therefore, the infrastructural and resource preparedness should be done in order to effectively control a possible global outbreak of the COVID-19. Among other measures, the WHO has put focuses on providing logistics and supply chain supports for rapid response and effective control of the COVID-19 spread in many countries and areas [87]. In this regard, the model proposed in this paper may be used, not only in Wuhan but also in other major cities exposed to the risk of the COVID-19 outbreak, for the decision-support of epidemic reverse logistics network design for effective management of increased medical waste generation.",

In order to improve the location decisions of temporary facilities and the operational planning of the temporary system, a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer programming model is proposed in this paper. The model aims at balancing the trade-off among the risk at sources, the risk of transportation and treatment of medical waste, and the total cost. An interactive fuzzy approach was used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and to generate a set of efficient Pareto optimal solutions. The application of the mathematical model and solution method is illustrated with a real-world case study based on the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In order to estimate the medical waste generation within the planning horizon, a SEIR model was first built up in AnyLogic simulation package. The optimization model was then solved by Lingo 18.0 based on the real data by the time of this research and several assumptions. Taking into account the generality of the problem under investigation, four policy recommendations were given for a better decision-making of the reverse logistics design for medical waste management in epidemic outbreak. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak is at developing stage and the future spread tendency is still unclear. Particularly, it is noted the number of infections has significantly increased not only in China but also around the globe [10]. Due to this, the planning and establishment of temporary reverse logistics system for medical waste management may shortly become to a challenge in many countries. Therefore, the main contributions of this research can be summarized as follows:(1)A novel multi-objective multi-period model is developed to optimize on the most important decisions, namely, facility location, time of operation, and transportation planning.(2)The model focuses on the short-term decisions and the characteristics of the reverse logistics network design for medical waste management in epidemic outbreak.(3)The applicability of the model is illustrated with a real-world case study, based on which general policy recommendations are given.",
