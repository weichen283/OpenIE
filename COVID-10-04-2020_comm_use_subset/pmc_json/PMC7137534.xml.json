ASPs are now ubiquitous. They often include pharmacists and physicians with advanced infectious diseases training, and they are a valuable part of hospital safety and quality programs. In some hospitals, compartmentalization of stewardship and epidemiology functions have developed over time to meet distinct institutional needs. However, domains should coalesce for purposes of emergency preparedness. The current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 outbreak highlights numerous opportunities where ASPs can support emerging pathogen response and planning efforts.",

This yielded 254 responses: 30% noted direct involvement, 28% indicated indirect involvement, and 39% indicated no involvement in emergency response efforts or planning. Although formalized study is needed, real-time insights from the community provided valuable information.

Because ASPs and infection prevention programs share similar technology infrastructure, data, and metrics, program integration has many advantages.2 Response efforts to novel respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 represent an opportunity for programs to formally integrate, to develop cross-coverage capabilities, and to create shared leadership opportunities.",

A core component of antimicrobial stewardship includes postprescriptive review with feedback to providers.3 In this way, an ASP skill set can theoretically assist with early identification of potential cases. This approach may be especially useful in situations in which the definition of a person under investigation is fluid because traditional epidemiologic efforts usually focus on identifying patients at the point of entry into health systems. ASPs often coordinate with microbiology laboratories for real-time interpretation and action involving upper respiratory PCR test results. They can support SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 evaluation efforts in this fashion as well. Novel respiratory virus outbreaks associated with secondary bacterial pneumonias and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) provide an opportunity for ASPs to monitor compliance with guideline-concordant therapy; severe COVID-19 cases have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.4\n",
