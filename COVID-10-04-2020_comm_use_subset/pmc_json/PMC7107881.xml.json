Their in situ observations also found that PEO additives reduce the propagation velocity of cracks by a factor of 50. In their paper, the colleagues proposed a crack nucleation mechanism that may be responsible for the sluggish cracking behavior. [Sci China-Phys Mech Astron, 2013; 56(9): 1712\u20138]",

Organelles in the plant secretory pathway revealed a gradual acidification, from pH 7.1 in the endoplasmic reticulum to pH 5.2 in the vacuole. Such a unique map will serve as an important tool for future studies in understanding organelle-mediated protein trafficking and organelle function in plants. [Mol Plant, 2013; 6(5): 1419\u201337]",

The results, achieved using X-ray crystallography and biochemical methods, can guide the development of therapeutics and vaccines against infection. Structural comparisons also revealed similarities and differences in the spike receptor-binding domain between MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory symptom coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which bind to different human receptors but share clinical and genetic features.

This well-preserved, simple bowl-shaped crater measures 1 800 m in diameter with a depth of about 150 m. Using crater impact morphological theory and mathematical modeling, scientists studied the cratering process and morphological features. The recently published work demonstrated that the Xiuyan Crater represents not just a tangible link between earth and space, but has important scientific applications, facilitating further studies into e.g. the regional paleo-climate and environment [Sci China-Earth Sci, 2013; 56(10): 1629\u201338]",
