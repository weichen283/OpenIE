It was first isolated from a monkey in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda, and the first isolation of the virus from a human was also found to be in Uganda in the 1960s [3, 4]. Later, ZIKV was discovered in human populations in many countries including Sierra Leone, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India; however, it was not a major public concern at that time [3\u20135]. Attention to ZIKV reached a global level after an outbreak in Latin America in 2015 [2]. ZIKV can primarily spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes, especially the Aedes aegypti type [1, 2]. In addition, this virus can be transmitted through sexual contact or by an infected pregnant woman to her fetus, which may lead to microcephaly, a serious birth defect of the brain [3, 6\u20138].",

This is particularly important in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) as every year more than 2 million people visit the country from various regions of the world for pilgrimage, which increases the risk of infections with various communicable diseases including the ZIKV [14]. Hence, HCPs need to have sufficient knowledge about the widespread infectious diseases, their symptoms, modes of transmission, and methods of prevention and treatment. Although multiple studies have been published globally on assessing the knowledge regarding ZIKV among HCPs, this study is the first of its kind to be conducted in Saudi Arabia [9, 15\u201317]. The purpose of our study is to assess the knowledge of HCPs regarding ZIKV in Riyadh, KSA.",

In our study, there is a significant difference in knowledge between age groups and different departments. Participants who aged 45 years or more had more knowledge regarding ZIKV compared with younger participants. Compared with other specialties, internal medicine physicians were more knowledgeable about ZIKV which might be justified by the fact that this specialty is broader in nature than others and encompasses multiple areas. When it comes to years of practice, HCPs whose experience is 10 years or more had slightly more knowledge, but it was not statistically significant. Majority of the participants were aware that ZIKV is a communicable disease and of viral origin. Majority were also aware that pregnant women are the most vulnerable population to ZIKV and its ability to cause birth defects.",

Furthermore, a study conducted among HCPs in Indonesia showed comparable results (50%) [16]. Another study conducted among Middle Eastern practitioners in Qatar found that among 446 participants, 66% reported poor knowledge regarding ZIKV [15]. Moreover, a study surveyed practitioners from different countries revealed that the majority of participants have an inadequate knowledge regarding ZIKV [17]. However, a recent study conducted among general practitioners (GPs) in Indonesia showed that 64% of them had good knowledge regarding ZIKV [18]. In addition, another recent study conducted among GPs in Indonesia showed that 66.5% of them had a good knowledge of pregnancy-related issues of ZIKV [19]. In our study, the majority of the respondents have an inadequate knowledge about ZIKV. Also, the knowledge level about ZIKV was significantly different by age; those aged 45 or more had significantly better knowledge than others.
