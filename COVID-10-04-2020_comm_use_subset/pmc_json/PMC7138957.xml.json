It has been causing an increasing rate of pneumonia cases since late December 2019 [2\u20134]. Infections were first identified in Wuhan, China, before being detected in other Chinese cities and in more than a dozen countries around the world by early February 2020 [5]. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO on 30 January 2020. COVID-19-infected pneumonia is characterized by flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some cases death [6\u20138]. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the virus [9\u201311], which is considered related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the COVID-19 is a serious threat to human health [7, 12]. As of 16 March 2020, nearly 170,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the world [13]. Effective prevention and treatment are crucial in this situation.",

During the SARS epidemics, traditional Chinese herbal medicine treatments were reported to have successfully prevented and treated SARS [17\u201319]. Furthermore, traditional Chinese herbal medicine combined with western medicine treatment regimen reduced adverse events and other complications induced by glucocorticoid, antibiotic, and antiviral treatments [20, 21].",

Results of the pilot risk of bias will be discussed among review authors and assessors. Two independent reviewers (YL and DZ) will assess the risk of bias of the included studies at study level. We will follow the guidance in the latest version of Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews of interventions [26] when choosing and using tools to assessing risk of bias for randomized trials (version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials, RoB 2 [27]) and non-randomized trials (the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions, ROBINS-I tool [28]). Any disagreements will be discussed and resolved in discussion with a third reviewer (RJ). Studies with high risk of bias or unclear bias will be given less weight in our data synthesis.",

In 2002, traditional Chinese herbal medicine played an important role in the treatment of SARS, and 58.3% of confirmed cases received traditional Chinese herbal medicine [32]. A Cochrane Review [33] found that Chinese herbs combined with western medicine significantly improved symptoms of SARS, including decreasing body temperature, cough and breathing difficulties, dosages of corticosteroids, improving absorption of pulmonary infiltration, and quality of life. A review [34] of 90 studies of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for SARS revealed positive but inconclusive results about the efficacy of combined treatment, using traditional Chinese herbal medicine as an adjuvant. Based on previous experience of treating SARS with traditional Chinese herbal medicine, the General Office of the National Health and Health Commission of China and the Office of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine encouraged the integration of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and western medicine. Different prescriptions are recommended in different stages of disease.",
