For a disease in which infected people may become immune, a perturbation out of the state with nobody infected (I = 0) leads eventually to the state with no susceptibles remaining (S = 0). Deterministic compartmental models have stochastic cousins such as the Reed\u2013Frost model (Abbey 1952), which allow for the possibility of stochastic outbreak extinction.

Although the basic reproductive number is often treated as a biologically determined characteristic of the pathogen\u2019s transmissibility, it is actually a combination of biological, environmental, behavioral, and social characteristics, including relative transmissibility via different pathways (e.g., transmission by airborne droplets vs. transmission via surfaces or body fluids); local weather\u2019s effects on the ability of the virus to survive and/or infect new hosts; and the host\u2019s contacts with other potential hosts.

The impact of the epidemic can be substantially mitigated if the demand for health care resources does not outstrip the supply. In analogy with firefighting, flattening the curve accomplishes this by slowing the rate of burn as in a controlled burn. Delaying the peak works by temporarily extinguishing the flames, perhaps leaving the embers glowing. Both reduce the effective R, sometimes through the same measures, and the fire will re-ignite in both when those measures are lifted. The difference lies in the shape of the epidemic curve afterward. Controlling, but not extinguishing, the burn reduces S and hence the reproductive number when the fire re-ignites. The overall infection attack rate AR\u2014the fraction of the population that eventually becomes infected\u2014is typically a sigmoidal function of R that is not very sensitive to R as long as it is above 1.

Hence, flattening the curve does not significantly reduce the total number of people infected unless medical countermeasures can be developed during the delay it affords. In contrast, suppression works by driving infections to the (unstable) I = 0 fixed point. The reproductive number when control measures are lifted in this case will be the same as before they were imposed. Suppression may reduce morbidity and mortality substantially, but only if it is global and simultaneous or continues long enough for pharmaceutical interventions to be developed. When illness severity depends on demographics, mitigation measures are most efficient when they are demographically targeted; suppression measures are most efficient when they are spatially and temporally targeted.",

Such models are well suited for representing demographically related heterogeneity in the course of illness or contact rates. The number of transition rates required to specify the model increases as the square of the number of partitions. At some point, depending on the modeler, it becomes natural to represent the model as a network of interacting partitions. Taken to the extreme, each host is in its own partition and the model is known as an individual-based model (Eubank 2004).",

Modelers have generally been slow to adopt individual-based models because of these challenges; rather, they felt that capturing individual heterogeneities was unnecessary. However, driven by important heterogeneities in the risk of HIV infection and the targeting of interventions, network models and individual-based models of small populations started to become popular around the turn of the century (Morris and Kretzschmar 1997; Black and Singer 1987). Individual-based models can represent not only biological, but also social heterogeneities, which are increasingly important aspects of pandemics. It is difficult to draw clear conclusions without such methods because individuals\u2019 circumstances, perceptions, deliberations, and social conventions are rather centrally causal. Even a single individual\u2019s behavior can carry out very important consequences. Hence, due to management of information and policies affecting individuals\u2019 responses, biologically similar diseases and circumstances can have different outcomes that will not be captured by aggregate models.",

The 9/11 attacks prompted then Vice President Cheney to propose vaccinating the entire population of the USA against smallpox.

Then, as now, the emergence of a novel, highly lethal strain of influenza was perceived to be an imminent threat. MIDAS researchers prepared for their possible roles in an emergency by studying two questions of interest to pandemic preparedness planners:In the event of an outbreak in, for example, Southeast Asia, should we commit our resources to containing the outbreak there, or should we reserve them to mitigate its eventual spread to the USA? (Ferguson et al. 2005; Longini et al. 2005).Given limited supplies of antivirals, how effective would a strategy of targeted, layered containment (TLC) be in controlling an epidemic in the USA until a vaccine could be developed?

The TLC models and results are certainly applicable to the current COVID-19 outbreak, although there are important differences:Not only is no vaccine available for SARS-CoV-2, but also no existing antivirals are known to be effective in treating illness or reducing transmissibility. The social distancing part of TLC is the only part relevant to the current COVID-19 epidemic.Unlike the influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging pathogen, not a novel variant of a well-known human pathogen. This has implications for public perceptions, development of diagnostic tests, and medical countermeasures. Moreover, the demographics of the illness, such as variations in the severity of illness, from asymptomatic to those requiring ventilator support, are almost unknown.The organization of society is rapidly changing due to near-universal access to high-bandwidth telecommunications and social media, affecting both the ability to communicate how to implement social distancing correctly and the dissemination of false information.",

Thus, the brunt of suppressing COVID-19 falls on social distancing and the associated efforts to manage and control individual and population behaviors. There is no doubt that sufficient social distancing can suppress an outbreak of a droplet-borne respiratory disease. However, there is also no doubt that society could not continue to function if everyone withdrew to the home for the several weeks necessary for complete suppression. Indeed, the very notion of a society assumes that personal survival does not depend solely on individual decisions.",

The authors consider a strategy which cycles between maximum and minimum social distancing. Their most important assumptions are about the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing the reproductive number, the rate of case ascertainment, and the amount of infection before detection. The Imperial team, as usual, has taken great care to calibrate parameters of the disease model. To be sure, calibration has been hampered by the lack of testing, especially our poor understanding of the prevalence of asymptomatic infection, but the Imperial College team makes reasonable assumptions. However, the model\u2019s reliance on a simplified picture of social interactions limits its extensibility to counterfactuals. The general nature of conclusions based on such a model can be expected to be similar to those of a simple compartmental model.",

They appear to have been influential in convincing policy-makers in the UK and the USA of the threat posed by COVID-19. They have stimulated discussion of novel mitigation strategies, although, once again, there is skepticism about the feasibility of on-again and off-again interventions. Such strategies not only depend on effective communication and adherence, but also on the premise of zero delay between sensing (e.g., ICU occupancy) and reacting (social distancing). The natural delay between imposing restrictions and seeing a drop in confirmed cases (as seen in Wuhan) will create social hysteresis loops. Also, it will be difficult for most officials to relax controls in the certain knowledge that many people will be infected.",

However, marshalling the available evidence into a scalable, customizable model that is easy for non-computer specialists to use and that addresses a wide range of questions about a variety of strategies remains a challenge.
