The report from the 30 January 2020 International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) stressed the importance of the continued sharing of full data with the World Health Organization (WHO). The information disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and accompanying online data sets is vital for decision-makers.1\u20133 For example, the release of full viral genome sequences through a public access platform and the polymerase chain reaction assay protocols that were developed as a result made it possible to accurately diagnose infections early in the current emergency.",
