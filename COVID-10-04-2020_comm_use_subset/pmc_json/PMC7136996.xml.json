            "text": "Shigellosis, caused by Shigella spp which are Gram-negative bacteria, is a fecal-oral transmission disease with a symptom of severe colitis and induced by a very low infectious dose [1, 2]. In developing countries, Shigella spp are one of the top four attributable causes of moderate\u2013severe diarrhea in children younger than 5 years. Shigellosis is an illness that kills roughly 750,000 people per year [3\u20135]. Although the incidence of shigellosis has declined remarkably due to the rapid improvements in water supply and sanitation in China [6], a considerable disease burden still exists and is unevenly distributed across the country [7\u20139]. Because of the different transmission conditions resulted from social-economic factors such as water supply and hygiene practices in different areas, the transmission of shigellosis is heterogeneous and is still a major public health problem in many areas in China [7, 10, 11]. The transmission interruption has a public importance in China as well as many developing countries. Generally, whether an infectious disease spreads or not depends on the size of transmissibility or \u201ctransmission force\u201d behind the transmission. However, to our knowledge, there is no study investigating the transmissibility of shigellosis. Therefore, an understanding the transmissibility of shigellosis is of great significance to ensure a better disease prevention and control.",

However, because of the disease intervention or the decreasing proportion of susceptible individuals due to the spread of the pathogen, it is hard to estimate R0. Therefore, effective reproduction number (Reff) is commonly employed instead, with the definition of the number of new cases which was produced by a typical case during the period of infection [16, 17]. From the definition, it is clear that when Reff > 1, the disease is able to spread in the population. If Reff < 1, the infection will be cleared from the population. Therefore, Reff = 1 is considered as the \u201cepidemic threshold\u201d.",

And we found that the transmissibility of shigellosis was different in females was higher than that of males [20]. However, we still do not know the values of Reff and their trends.

According to our previous research [19], k, \u03c9, p, \u03b3, \u03b3\u2019, c, and \u03b5 are disease-specific parameters which could be estimated from literatures. The incubation period of shigellosis is 1\u20134 days [24, 25], and most commonly 1 day, therefore, \u03c9 = 1.0. The proportion of asymptomatic infection ranges from 0.0037 to 0.27 [26\u201328], and it can be set p = 0.1. The infectious period of symptomatic infection is 13.5 days [19], therefore, \u03b3 = 0.0741. According to our previous research [19], the infectious period of asymptomatic infection could be simulated 5 weeks in our model, thus \u03b3\u2019 = 0.0286. Because of that the die-off rate of Shigella spp is about 24.5 h [29], \u03b5 = 0.6931 was consequently simulated [19]. In our previous research [19], a typical case has diarrhea about 3.2 times (range 3\u201312 times) per day but an asymptomatic individual only sheds stool once per day, thus c = 0.3125. Due to reduction of shedding frequency, the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic individual (k) was modeled to be a reduced quantity as 0.3125 [19].",

We also found that the incidence of shigellosis in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas. It might due to the higher population density in urban areas.

Therefore, the remained major transmission route is person to person which will be the main public health focus to control the disease. This result also provided a mathematical evidence of the epidemiological characteristics of shigellosis that the pathogen was transmitted primarily through person-to-person [24]. Therefore, a combined strategy of case management would be strongly recommended including case isolation and treatment, environment disinfection, surveillance system improvement, and individuals\u2019 health behaviors improvement like hand hygiene.",

Although the Linear, Quadratic, and Cubic models had the best goodness of fit, the 95%CIs of Quadratic model and Cubic model were not stable after the year 2019 (Fig. 7). Therefore, the Linear model was recommended to predict the trends of the transmissibility. The Linear model predicted that the Reff would down to an epidemic threshold (Reff = 1.00) in 2029. This was an interesting result which meant that the disease would probably be eliminated after the year of 2029. But this result was based on the assumption that the transmission condition would remain stable in the future years. Therefore, this trend might be different in other provinces. Hubei Province is located in a lake region with many cities suffered from floods frequently. The transmissibility of Shigellosis would be increased after the flood and provides a potential transmission route of water to person. On the other hand, the year of the transmission interrupted might be ahead of schedule since the disease control strategy would be strengthened in the future years, especially with the progress of \u201cHealth China\u201d action launched by the Chinese government. More researches are needed to simulate the trend of transmissibility of the shigellosis with the interventions considered.",
