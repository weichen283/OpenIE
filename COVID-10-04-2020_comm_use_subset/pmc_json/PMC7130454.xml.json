A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify the crucial components of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention that could improve patient activation and self-management behaviours. Three crucial components were identified on the basis of three CCM elements (i.e., delivery system design, self-management support and decision support) and will be included in the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Self-Management e-Health Intervention as described in Table 1.

The iterative model was chosen as the software development model for this study [58]. Content from the newly revised EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Global Cardiovascular Risks Self-Management Booklet was evaluated for its suitability to be included in the prototype. A storyboard was designed to create the flow of prototype use by PCPs, nurses and patients during follow-up in the clinic and at home. In the pre-alpha stage, wireframe was designed to describe and visualise the user interface in static draft layouts based on the content and structure of information. Based on the wireframe, high-fidelity mock-up static graphic diagrams demonstrating the content and function of the prototype divided into eight sections were designed. The sections included My Profile, My Cardiovascular Risks, My Treatment Targets, My Check-Up, My Weight Management, My Smoking Habit, My Self-Management, and My Medication. Persuasive technology theory [39, 59] was used to build the evidence-based content, which is presented in a user-friendly interface, with incorporation of interactivity and a reward system. This app is designed to aid and motivate people to adopt a positive attitude and behaviour change through persuasion and a reward system. The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN mock prototype mobile app is provided in Additional file 2. Based on the mock graphic diagrams, a working prototype of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN self-management mobile app was developed using the iterative model of the Software Development Life Cycle [58, 60]. A complementary desktop application is also being developed for the PCPs and nurses to use in the clinic. This prototype is currently undergoing alpha (utility) testing by medical experts [61, 62] and beta (usability) testing by patients with MetS [63]. Data which are entered by the PCPs and patients into the app will be stored in a secure server. The feasibility of using the app will be evaluated in this pilot study.",

The PCPs and nurse will be trained on the basis of Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which would be useful for them to understand how patients\u2019 behaviour change can be influenced by health care providers [65]. They will also be trained in motivational interview (MI) techniques and health-coaching skills to facilitate patients\u2019 autonomous self-regulation to enhance their behaviour change [65\u201368]. MI training would include the skills to formulate open-ended questions, reflective statements (i.e., restating what the patients conveyed) and stimulating what the patients know before providing relevant education [65]. The main aim of the MI is to engage patients in problem solving by encouraging active learning [66] and facilitating patients\u2019 autonomous self-regulation to achieve goals by enabling patients to develop individualised action plans [67, 68].",

Patients will be given the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN self-management app, which will be downloaded to their mobile phone. Follow-up care by the PCPs will be arranged at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. At baseline, patients in the intervention arm will be given a username and password to access the app. They will be trained individually on its use by the PCPs assisted by a nurse using the Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework [69] and the persuasive technology theory [39, 59]. The KTA Framework incorporates the need to adapt the knowledge to fit with individual context. In addition to this, PCPs and the nurse will provide problem-solving assistance and support for patients to use the app in line with the theory of persuasive technology. MI techniques and health-coaching skills to facilitate patients\u2019 autonomous self-regulation to enhance their behaviour change will also be applied. PCPs and the nurse will go through each section with the patients and will ensure that information recorded in all sections is complete. Patients will be guided to navigate through the functions of the mobile app to ensure competence, especially on the sections involving self-management. Patients will be coached to use the app and to review their progress at home (e.g., self-monitoring of their weight, BP and blood glucose) and recording of their PA and diet. Particular attention will be given to specific pages of the app which summarise patients\u2019 achievement in their self-management goals and clinical outcomes. These achievements will be rewarded with a star rating in accordance with the persuasive technology theory. PCPs and the nurse will discuss self-management progress and goals using the app with the patients at each follow-up visit. The goal of the intervention is to improve patient activation and self-management behaviours through patient\u2013physician collaboration and regular reinforcement to ensure sustainability. Figure 3 illustrates the delivery of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Self-Management e-Health Intervention.\n",

The instrument design reflects the four stages of activation in a progressing degree of difficulty of the items: level 1 (patients believe that their role is important: items 1 and 2), level 2 (patients have confidence and knowledge to take action: items 3\u20138), level 3 (taking action: items 9\u201311) and level 4 (staying on course under stress: items 12 and 13). According to the PAM-13 scoring guidelines, the raw scores are transformed through natural logarithm to achieve a better expression of the relative distance between the scores. Then, items are transformed to a standardised metric ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = lowest activation; 100 = highest activation). The score is calculated by summing the raw scores and mapping the sum onto a scale of 0\u2013100. A higher score of PAM-13 indicates a high level of patient activation [24]. The PAM-13 is one of the most extensively used, widely translated and tested instruments worldwide in measuring patient activation level in self-management. It has been translated into the Malay language and is currently being validated in the study population. Research licence to use this questionnaire will be obtained from Insignia Health, University of Oregon.",

Random allocation will be done in order to keep the sizes of the groups similar. In this study, the block randomisation size will be four times the number of treatment arms (i.e., block size of 2 by 2). With two treatment arms of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Self-Management e-Health Intervention (I) or usual care (C), the possible treatment allocations within each block [85] will be as follows: IICC, ICIC, ICCI, CCII, CICI, CIIC. A research assistant will generate the allocation sequence, enrol the participants and assign the patients to the intervention or control arms according the sequence. The generated sequence will be placed in sealed envelopes to ensure that it is concealed from the PCPs until the intervention is assigned. Blinding is not possible, owing to the complexity of the intervention.",
