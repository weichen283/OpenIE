This thirst for information is to address their knowledge gaps, inform their understanding of current events and future developments, and, importantly, help determine how vulnerable they are to contracting COVID\u201019 and what actions need to be taken for prevention and treatment. We expect accurate, timely and reliable information provided in a way that can be quickly accessed and easily understood. In this digital age, information has become a commodity that we expect to have ready access to, and receive much more frequently than in the past, via reputable news media and their online and social networking sites. We expect to receive accurate and reliable information from national and international organizations we trust, and, in turn, we expect that these organizations have received accurate and trustworthy data to report. We certainly expect the truth, but understand that up\u2010to\u2010date information may not always be possible, considering the time lag in data collection and data reporting, and the variable resources available globally to collate data. Lack of information, misinformation and inaccurate information can lead to hysteria and fuel behavioural outcomes such as panic buying.\n3\n A well\u2010informed public is critical at a time when the community is impacted by a viral outbreak.",

This goes beyond simply being told to practise good hygiene\u2014people need to know exactly what good hygiene entails. For example, we know we must wash our hands, but do we know when, how frequently, with what and for how long? If we are expecting to educate people, then the information must be understandable and actionable. If 20 seconds of hand washing with soap is part of practising good hygiene,\n4\n then this is the information that should be effectively communicated. Better still, it should be linked with an easily remembered action, such as singing a song that lasts 20 seconds.\n4\n People also need to know how effective preventative measures are. An understanding of the rationale for behaviour and its associated benefits and impact is more likely to motivate people to adopt the behaviour.",

We expect to know what happens to a person who becomes infected with COVID\u201019. Clear and consistent information about the impact of an infection in otherwise healthy individuals, as well as in children, the elderly and those with underlying health problems is vital when people are facing a pandemic. With nearly 180 000 people (as of 17 March 2020) infected globally,\n5\n there should be enough data to accurately provide information about symptoms, severity and duration of the infection; as well as full recovery and mortality rates; characteristics of those recovering and those who have succumbed to the virus; cause(s) of death; and potential for reinfection.",

We look to our governments to have COVID\u201019 action plans that would protect us from a pandemic. And undoubtedly, we want well\u2010resourced health\u2010care systems that enable timely and appropriate health\u2010care delivery, capable of effectively treating us should we end up in the infectious diseases ward of a hospital. We expect our health\u2010care workers to be supported and looked after so that they remain healthy to look after those infected. In short, we expect and hope to be filled with a sense of security when we are on the brink of a pandemic. This sense of security can come from knowledge that we are receiving timely, accurate and reliable information from trustworthy sources that are \u2018louder\u2019 than those sources providing biased, inaccurate and incorrect information.",

However, has there been a person\u2010centred approach to the actions taken to date? Has there been equity, between the public and those within the government and health\u2010care systems, in the processes implemented to ensure that the public are involved in the decisions made and plans prepared? How can we better engage the public in preparing for, and to act, in the face of a pandemic?",
