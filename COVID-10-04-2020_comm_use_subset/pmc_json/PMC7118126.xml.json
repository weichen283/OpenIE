Particularly, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 89.8% sequence identity in their spike (S) proteins S2 subunits, which mediate the membrane fusion process, and both of their S1 subunits utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells.6 Most importantly, the ACE2-binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10- to 20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV,12 which may contribute to the higher infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can mediate membrane fusion in a manner that exceeds the capacity of SARS-CoV.",

By intranasal application of this peptide, either pre- or post-challenge with coronavirus, the treated mice were protected from HCoV-OC43 or MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide has prophylactic and therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.14 Indeed, our recent studies have shown that EK1 peptide is effective against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection in a dose-dependent manner.15",

We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s 6-HB core and identified several mutated amino acid residues in HR1 domain responsible for its enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. By conjugating the cholesterol molecule to the EK1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, EK1C4, exhibited highly potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, about 240- and 150-fold more potent than EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 is also highly effective against in vitro and in vivo infection of some live HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, suggesting potential for further development as pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based therapeutics and prophylactics for treatment and prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, as well as future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging SARSr-CoVs.",

Indeed, in live SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found a typical syncytium phenomenon naturally formed by infected cells, which is rarely reported in SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1c). To further explore the special characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cloned the S gene into PAAV-IRES-GFP vector and established the S-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion system, using 293T cells that express SARS-CoV-2 S protein and EGFP (293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP) as the effector cells, and ACE2/293T cells expressing human ACE2 receptor as the target cells (Fig. 1d and Supplementary information, Fig. S1a). After effector cells and target cells were cocultured at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, the fused cells showed at least 2-fold larger size than normal cells and multiple nuclei, and these cells were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 group, but not the SARS-CoV group. After coincubation for 24 h, hundreds of target cells fused together as one big syncytium, containing multiple nuclei (Fig. 1d). Another 24 h later, the syncytium grew bigger and could be easily observed under both light and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1e). Similar results were observed in the fusion between 293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP cells and Huh-7 cells, which naturally express human ACE2 receptor on the cell surface. Their syncytium was obviously formed after coincubation for 48 h, similar to the syncytium formed by live SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh-7 cells (Fig. 1c, f). On the contrary, SARS-CoV S protein lacked the ability to mediate the cell\u2013cell fusion under the same conditions (Fig. 1d) based on the required presence of exogenous trypsin to complete membrane fusion in our previous studies. Therefore, compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed much more efficiency in mediating viral surface-fusion and entry into target cells.14 Meanwhile, no fusion was observed for 293T/EGFP cells without S-expression or 293T cells without ACE2-expression (Fig. 1d and Supplementary information, Fig. S1b), confirming that S-receptor engagement is necessary for the S-mediated viral fusion and entry.",

The crystal structure of HR1-L6-HR2 shows a canonical 6-HB structure with a rod-like shape 115 \u00c5 in length and 25 \u00c5 in diameter (Fig. 2b). The three HR1 domains form a parallel trimeric coiled-coil center, around which three HR2 domains are entwined in an antiparallel manner. The interaction between these two domains is predominantly a hydrophobic force. Each pair of two adjacent HR1 helices forms a deep hydrophobic groove, providing the binding site for hydrophobic residues of the HR2 domain, including V1164, L1166, I1169, I1172, A1174, V1176, V1177, I1179, I1183, L1186, V1189, L1193, L1197 and I1198 (Fig. 2c).

Inside the fusion core region of HR1 domain, there are 8 different residues (Fig. 3a), which may contribute the enhanced interactions between HR1 and HR2 and stabilize 6-HB conformation of SARS-CoV-2 as revealed by crystallographic analysis, compared with those of SARS-CoV. This significant difference has not been observed in other SARS-like viruses, such as WIV1, Rs3367, and RsSHC014. As shown in Fig. 3b, the K911 in SARS-CoV HR1 could bind to E1176 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.9 \u00c5 in distance. However, with the Lys-Ser replacement, S929 in SARS-CoV-2 binds to S1196 through a strong hydrogen bond 2.4 \u00c5 in distance. In SARS-CoV, Q915 in the HR1 domain does not bind to the HR2 domain. However, with Q-K replacement in the new virus, K933 in the HR1 domain binds to carbonyl oxygen of N1172 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3b). In SARS-CoV, E918 in the HR1 domain binds to R1166 in the HR2 domain through a weak salt bridge 3.7 \u00c5 in distance. In SARS-CoV-2, E918 is mutated to D936 and binds to R1185 in the HR2 domain through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3c). In SARS-CoV, K929 in HR1 binds to E1163 in HR2 through a salt bridge 3.2 \u00c5 in distance, while T925 is not involved in the interaction. However, when T925 was mutated to S943, it could bind to E1182 in the HR2 domain with a hydrogen bond 2.6 \u00c5 in distance, and K947 could also bind to E1182 through a salt bridge 3.0 \u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3d). These results suggested that the multiple replacements in the HR1 domain of emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus could enhance the interactions between HR1 and HR2 domain to further stabilize the 6-HB structure, which may lead to increased infectivity of the virus.",

Both of them could completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell\u2013cell fusion at the concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM (Fig. 4b). The inhibitory activity with mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values is 48.1 nM for EK1C and 69.2 nM for EK1P, respectively (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, the EK1-scrambled peptide showed no inhibitory activity with the concentration up to 5 \u03bcM (Fig. 4c).

Compared with EK1C1, EK1C2 and EK1C showed similar inhibitory activities. Strikingly, EK1C3 peptide with both the 3-amino acid linker \u201cGSG\u201d and the PEG4-based spacer, exhibited 4-fold more potency than EK1C1. It is noteworthy that changing \u201cGSG\u201d in EK1C3 to a longer 5-amino acid linker \u201cGSGSG\u201d significantly increased the inhibitory potency of the hybrid molecule, and EK1C4 had IC50 value of 1.3 nM, which was 43-fold more potent than EK1C1. These findings indicate that the linker length has a significant effect on the overall activity of lipopeptides. Comparison of increasing PEG-based arm lengths in EK1C4 shows that inhibitors potency slightly decreased in the cell\u2013cell fusion assay (Fig. 4e). The data suggest that \u201cGSGSG-PEG4\u201d linker was optimal to bridge both parts of the conjugates. Similarly, EK1C4 showed the most potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 PsV infection, with IC50 value of 15.8 nM, providing 149-fold stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity than that of EK1 (IC50 = 2,375 nM) (Fig. 4f).",

Among them, SARS-CoV has the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2, and its S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion could be effectively inhibited by EK1C4 with IC50 of 4.3 nM, which is about 94-fold more active than that of EK1 (IC50 = 409.3 nM) (Fig. 5a). Similarly, EK1C4 showed extremely potent fusion-inhibitory activity on MERS-S- and OC43-S-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion with IC50 of 2.5 nM and 7.7 nM, which were 95- and 101-fold more potent when compared to EK1, respectively, indicating that EK1C4 could potently and broadly inhibit S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion of various \u03b2-HCoVs (Fig. 5b, c). For \u03b1-HCoVs, EK1C4 also effectively blocked the fusion process mediated by the S protein of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 with IC50 of 5.2 nM and 21.4 nM, respectively, while EK1 showed inhibitory activity of IC50 ranging from 207.4 to 751.0 nM (Fig. 5d, e). Moreover, with their potential for human infection, SL-CoVs, including WIV1, Rs3367 and RsSHC014, the fusion process of which is mediated by S protein, could also be significantly prevented by EK1C4 with IC50 ranging from 4.3 to 8.1 nM, as well as EK1 with IC50 ranging from 237.0 to 279.6 nM (Fig. 5f\u2013h).

We next assessed the cytotoxicity of EK1C4 on various target cells and found that the half cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was beyond 5 \u03bcM, which is the highest detection concentration of EK1C4 (Supplementary information, Fig. S3). Therefore, the selectivity index (SI = CC50/IC50) of EK1C4 is >136, suggesting that EK1C4 is a promising SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitor with little, or even no, toxic effect in vitro. Further, we explored the potent antiviral mechanism of EK1C4 and found that the complexes of EK1C4/SARS-HR1, EK1C4/MERS-HR1, and EK1C4/SARS-2-HR1 harbor higher stability and increased Tm values than those of the complexes formed by EK1 and HR1s (Supplementary information, Fig. S4). These results suggested that increased antiviral activity of EK1C4 should be related to its increased binding affinity with HR1, but their detailed interactions require further studies.",

Consistently, in the cell\u2013cell fusion system, SARS-CoV-2 S protein could effectively mediate the formation of syncytium between the effector cell and the target cell in the absence of an exogenous proteolytic enzyme, e.g., trypsin, while SARS-CoV S protein could not. Actually, the plasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosomal membrane fusion pathway for most viruses because the latter is more prone to activating the host cell antiviral immunity.23,24 Generally, \u03b2-B coronaviruses lack the S1/S2 furin-recognition site, and their S proteins are uncleaved in the native state. For example, SARS-CoV enters into the cell mainly via the endosomal membrane fusion pathway where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L and activated.25 Inducing the S1/S2 furin-recognition site could significantly increase the capacity of SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection.26 Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, but its specific role in S protein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle remains to be further explored (Supplementary information, Fig. S7). A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mainly used TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute an option for blocking SARS-CoV-2 fusion with and entry into the host cell.27",

In previous studies, we have found that HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 could form a stable coiled-coil complex, but the detailed conformations remain unknown. According to the X-ray crystallographic analysis of the complex formed by HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b), it is a typical 6-HB fusion core structure similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although the amino acid sequences of HR2 domain from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are fully identical, multiple residue differences occur in the HR1 domain of SARS-CoV-2. However, instead of weakening the interaction between HR1 and HR2, such unilateral difference seems to form new interactions in some regions and enhance the existing ones in other regions (Fig. 3). When K991 in SARS-CoV HR1 was replaced with S929 in SARS-CoV2 HR1, a new, strong hydrogen bond was formed with a distance of 2.4 \u00c5. K933 forms a new interaction with N1192 in SARS-CoV-2 with a distance of 2.7 \u00c5, whereas the corresponding position in SARS-CoV has no such interaction. In the other two regions, E918 binds to R1166 and K929 binds to E1163 in SARS-CoV, both of which were enhanced in SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that this new HCoV has evolved with improved binding affinity between HR1 and HR2 domains, which may accelerate the viral membrane fusion process and enhance viral infectivity or transmissibility. A recent study also found that the binding affinity between ACE2 receptor on the host cell and RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 10-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may also be associated with the increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.12",

There is a possibility that the cholesterol group could anchor to the target membrane to facilitate the binding of inhibitor to the HR1 targets. However, we noticed that binding affinity between EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2-HR1P is significantly enhanced than EK1 peptide alone, which suggested that cholesterol group may be involved in binding to HR1P directly (Supplementary information, Fig. S4). Therefore, using structural simulation and docking method, we predicted a possible model of EK1C4 in binding with SARS-CoV-2 HR1P (Supplementary information, Fig. S8). In this model, the EK1C4 peptide anchors to one of the three hydrophobic grooves of HR1 trimer via its EK1 moiety, and also anchors to another adjacent hydrophobic groove of HR1 trimer via its cholesterol moiety. The cholesterol group of EK1C4 may bind to HR1P through hydrophobic interactions, while several hydrogen bonds may form between HR1 and helical region of EK1C4. The intermediated GSGSG-PEG4 linker of EK1C4 peptide is just enough to connect these two moieties on the two binding targets. Admittedly, the exact mechanism and structure of EK1C4 need more studies in the future.",

            "text": "In the past few decades, the viral HR1 domain has been proved to be an important target for the development of viral fusion and entry inhibitors. In the early outbreak of MERS, we quickly solved the 6-HB fusion core structure formed by MERS-CoV S protein HR1 and HR2 domains and designed the fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2 which proved to be highly effective in blocking its spike protein-mediated membrane fusion and inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection.16 The results from animal experiments showed that intranasal application of HR2P-M2 peptide could effectively protect mice from MERS-CoV infection with reduction of virus titers in the lung more than 1000-fold.29 However, the MERS-CoV HR2P-M2 peptide could not inhibit SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide lacks cross-inhibitory activity against other \u03b2-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs. To be well prepared for combating the emerging coronaviruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, we designed and synthesized the first pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, and found that EK1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all HCoVs that we tested, including SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, as well as bat SARSr-CoVs. As expected, we recently have shown that EK1 is also effective in inhibiting infection of the novel \u03b2-CoV, SARS-CoV-2.15 We then optimized EK1 peptide in hopes of improving its fusion inhibitory activity. Indeed, we found that one of the modified EK1 peptides, EK1C4, was 226-fold and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, respectively, than EK1. EK1C4 also showed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other HCoVs. EK1C4 showed prolonged and significant prophylactic effect against HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse model, suggesting that EK1C4 may also be used as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Consistent with other studies,30 HCoV-OC43 was shown as a typical neurotropic virus in the mouse model, and quickly entered and established infection in mouse brain tissue, leading to the relatively weak therapeutic effect of EK1C4 via intranasal administration. However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected and caused severe pathological changes in human lung tissue.4 Therefore, EK1C4 administered intranasally is expected to have good therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Currently, no specific anti-CoV therapeutics or prophylactics have been used in clinics for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A number of nonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN, lopinavir-ritonavir (HIV protease inhibitors), chloroquine, favipiravir (T-705) and remdesivir (GS-5734), have been used in clinics in China to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.31 Their in vivo efficacies still require further confirmation. Their potential use for treatment of infection by other coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Compared with these clinically used nonspecific antiviral drugs, EK1C4 has more advantages for treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the sequence of its target, the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein, is highly conserved. Therefore, EK1C4 possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance and cannot easily induce drug-resistant mutations. Second, EK1C4 can be used in an intranasal formulation to prevent coronavirus infection. The small bottles can be carried easily by persons who will have close contact with infected patients or high-risk populations. Third, EK1C4 can be used in inhalation formulation for treatment of patients to reduce the viral loads in their lungs, thus attenuating the acute lung injury caused by viral infection and reducing the chance to spread the virions to the closely contacted persons. The inhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense of staying in hospitals. Fourth, EK1C4 is expected to be safe to humans because it will be used locally, not systemically, and peptide drugs are generally safer than chemical drugs. Fifth, because of its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, EK1C4 can be used for treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other HCoVs. Sixth, recently 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified,32 but we found that both HR1 and HR2 domains among those reported genomes show 100% identity (Supplementary information, Fig. S9), indicating the high conservation of EK1C4 target. In the meantime, the HR2 derived peptides have much larger interface on HR1 domain, making it more resistant to the viral mutations. Therefore, EK1C4 shows exceptional promise to be developed as the first pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based antiviral therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and the future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging SARSr-CoVs.",

A native set of X-ray diffraction data was collected with the R-AXIS IV++ detector (Rigaku, Japan) with an exposure time of 3 min per image and was indexed and processed using iMosflm.36 The space group of the collected dataset is P21. Molecular replacement was performed with PHENIX.phaser37 to solve the phasing problem, using the SARS-CoV S protein core structure (PDB code 1WYY) as a search model.
