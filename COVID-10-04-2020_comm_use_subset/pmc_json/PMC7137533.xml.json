Investigations have shown that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Coronaviruses are present in humans and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2.1,2\n",

Afterward, the disease spread very rapidly in adjacent provinces near Qom, such as Tehran, Markazi, Isfahan, and Semnan provinces, and shortly thereafter in all 31 provinces of the country. By March 8, 2020, according to Dr. Jahanpour, spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, the total number of infected people who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 had reached 6,566 and COVID-19 deaths had reached 194.4 Although these data continue to change, they show that the mortality rate has been \u223c2.9% in COVID-19\u2013positive cases.5 At the time of article submission, Iran ranked third in the number of people suffering from the disease after China and South Korea and second in the number of deaths and recovered cases.6,7\n",

The increase in travel related to the Nowruz holiday, which started even 15 days earlier due to the closure of schools and universities, increases the likelihood of transmission and circulation of the virus and increased prevalence of COVID-19. To effectively fight this serious disease, the government should take more stringent measures to significantly limit travel instead of simply advising citizens to stay at home.",
