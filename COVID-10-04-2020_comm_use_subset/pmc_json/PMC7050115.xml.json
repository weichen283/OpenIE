The sample was considered adequate if the KMO value was more than 0.5 and Bartlett\u2019s test was significant (P < 0.001). The Principal axis factoring method for the component extraction was used. Oblimin rotation with Kaiser normalization was applied in order to optimize the loading factor of each item on the extracted components. Dimensionality of the items in each domain was considered as continuous output and to facilitate its evaluation [22]. Components with Eigen values of over one was retained as components using parallel analysis and scree plot.

Parallel analysis for attitude sub-domain suggested a 4-factor model, however EFA was proceeded by fixing the number of factors to two based on the eigenvalue greater than one criterion. Those factors obtained were rotated using Oblimin method to make the factors more meaningful which propitiously resulted to two interpretable factors based on the relation among the items and the proposed domain. All the items had acceptable factor loading of > 0.3 in the attitude domain with the exception of items A1, A2, and A12B and therefore they were removed.",
