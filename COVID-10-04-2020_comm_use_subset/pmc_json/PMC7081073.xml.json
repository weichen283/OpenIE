            "text": "Members of the family Arteriviridae are positive-stranded RNA viruses with genome sizes ranging from 13 to 16 kb. The family currently comprises a single genus (Arterivirus) that includes four species: Equine arteritis virus (EAV), Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Faaberg et al., 2012; Snijder et al., 2013). Amongst those, the latter is the economically most relevant species causing annual losses to the American swine industry alone of \u223c$800 million (Sang et al., 2014). Additionally, several recently identified arteriviruses remain to be formally classified, but are likely to prototype multiple novel species or even higher-order taxa (Bailey et al., 2014; Dunowska et al., 2012; Lauck et al., 2011, 2013). Arterivirus genomes are polycistronic and contain 10\u201315 (known) ORFs. The 5\u2032-proximal ORFs 1a and 1b are expressed as polyproteins (pps) 1a and 1ab that are autoproteolytically processed into the non structural proteins (nsps) required for genome replication and transcription (Fig. 1) (Molenkamp et al., 2000). The remaining ORFs mostly encode structural proteins that are expressed from a set of subgenomic mRNAs (Pasternak et al., 2006). Based on overall similarities in terms of genome expression and organization, as well as synteny and homology of key replicase domains, the family Arteriviridae was united in the order Nidovirales with the families Mesoniviridae, Roniviridae and Coronaviridae, the latter including two distantly related subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae (de Groot et al., 2012a, b). In the nidovirus tree, the arteriviruses form a basal lineage next to the one that combines the three other families, which have substantially larger genomes (Nga et al., 2011).",

            "text": "ORF1b is the most conserved part of the nidovirus genome and all ORF1b-encoded proteins characterized thus far are enzymes conserved in two or more nidovirus families. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a zinc-binding domain (ZBD) fused with a superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1) are conserved in all nidoviruses. In contrast, six other domains are lineage specific. Four of these are conserved in two or three nidovirus families only: exoribonuclease (ExoN), N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), nidovirus uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase). Two other domains are as yet uncharacterized and unique to either roniviruses [ronivirus-specific domain (RsD)] or arteriviruses [arterivirus-specific domain (AsD)]. As five of the six lineage-specific domains occupy a unique position in the genome, the pattern of their conservation could be explained by loss or acquisition of a single domain during nidovirus evolution (Nga et al., 2011). The exception is AsD, which resides in the most C-terminal subunit of the arterivirus ORF1b polyprotein (nsp12), the position occupied by the 2\u2032-O-MTase protein in all other nidoviruses (nsp16 in coronaviruses; Fig. 1). If these positionally equivalent proteins are unrelated, as reported 14 years ago based on the analysis of only a few genome sequences and prior to the identification of the 2\u2032-O-MTase (Gorbalenya, 2001), their emergence would require the consideration of complex evolutionary hypotheses. Thus, the relation of AsD with the 2\u2032-O-MTase and other proteins must be re-evaluated whilst taking advantage of the increased availability of sequences and improved techniques.",

Two other coronavirus enzymes, HEL1 (nsp13) (Ivanov et al., 2004; Ivanov & Ziebuhr, 2004) and the N7-MTase (nsp14) (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2009), are also suspected or known to be involved in capping, whereas the fourth enzyme required (guanylyltransferase) remains to be identified. In vitro, the coronavirus N7-MTase and 2\u2032-O-MTase were found to cooperate during cap formation. The latter enzyme also requires the ORF1a-encoded nsp10 as a co-factor (Bouvet et al., 2010). Although arteriviruses were not characterized in detail, the SHFV genome was reported to be capped (Sagripanti et al., 1986) and they do encode a HEL1 (Seybert et al., 2000), which could contribute to capping. Thus, the discovery of arteriviral N7-MTase and/or 2\u2032-O-MTase activities could be readily accommodated in a functionally sensible manner.",

We show that, unlike the coronavirus 2\u2032-O-MTase, nsp12 is poorly conserved amongst known arteriviruses compared with the proteins carrying the endoribonuclease (nsp11) and helicase (nsp10) activities, and that it contains only one evolutionary invariant residue. No statistically significant similarity was found between arterivirus nsp12 and coronavirus nsp16 or other proteins although the two nidovirus proteins may belong to the same \u03b1/\u03b2-fold class. Likewise, no MTase activity was detected in carefully controlled assays using recombinant EAV nsp12 in the absence or presence of several other nsps that were included as potential co-factors. Using reverse genetics, a large set of EAV nsp12 mutants was generated and tested for replication, revealing phenotypes ranging from WT-like to replication-deficient, which broadly correlated with the natural variation of the probed residues. We conclude that nsp12 plays an essential role in EAV replication and discuss possible directions to elucidate its enigmatic function.",

We found that nsp12 was conserved in all established and provisional arterivirus species, including the most distantly related wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV). Inspection of the arterivirus conservation profile showed that the entire nsp12 sequence exhibits similarity values that are below average for this pp1ab region (0.320 on a scale from \u2212 0.1 to 1.0; Fig. 2a). Only the C-terminal domain of nsp10 and to some extent the ZBD were similarly divergent, whilst the similarity of the nsp10 helicase core and particularly nsp11 were above average. This remarkably low conservation distinguishes arterivirus nsp12 also from all proteins in this region of the coronaviruses (average conservation 0.491) and toroviruses (0.270), including nsp16 (Fig. 2b, c). Accordingly, arterivirus nsp12 contains the smallest number of conserved residues amongst the analysed proteins, with only a single phenylalanine (F109 in EAV) being evolutionarily invariant (Fig. 3). Other notable conserved nsp12 residues (out of 18 in total) were an asparagine, a serine/threonine and six aromatic residues. We also noted the presence of four conserved cysteines in a pattern typical for zinc fingers in the C-terminal part of nsp12 in the five simian arteriviruses, which constitute a phylogenetically compact cluster. Patristic pair-wise distances (PPDs) of nsp12 compared with those of ZBD, HEL1 and NendoU were consistently larger, whilst PPDs of (putative) 2\u2032-O-MTases were comparable on average with those of five other domains in the coronaviruses and toroviruses (Fig. S1, available in the online Supplementary Material). These results showed that, in comparison with the coronavirus 2\u2032-O-MTase, nsp12 must have evolved under unusually relaxed constraints or in a changing molecular environment. Secondary structure predictions using JPred and psipred consistently indicated the alternation of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands in arterivirus nsp12 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the coronavirus MTases also belong to the \u03b1/\u03b2 structural class and contain conserved aromatic residues (Chen et al., 2011; Decroly et al., 2011). Nevertheless, HH-suite profile\u2013profile comparison did not reveal sequence similarity above the background between nsp12 and the 2\u2032-O-MTase of coronaviruses or toroviruses, E = 0.41 and 0.53, respectively (Fig. S2). Furthermore, these proteins are also of different sizes: 119\u2013178 (arterivirus nsp12) versus 263\u2013312 aa (coronavirus nsp16), with the arterivirus proteins being also smaller than MTases of other origins. The above HH-based negative result contrasted with the strong similarity signal observed in (control) comparisons between arteriviruses and coronaviruses or toroviruses for HEL1 and NendoU (E \u2264 3.5 \u00d7 10\u201317) or in the control comparison between coronavirus and torovirus nsp16, E = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u201332 (Fig. S2). No statistically significant similarity was observed between nsp12 and other proteins in a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based scan of the Pfam-A database (top hit: PF12581, E = 1.0). We thus concluded that nsp12 has diverged beyond recognition from its homologues and differs considerably from the 2\u2032-O-MTase of large nidoviruses. Nevertheless, the results obtained did not rule out the possibility that it could be a deviant MTase, and we therefore set out to test this hypothesis experimentally by biochemical and molecular virological methods.",

In agreement with the published results (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2013), both SARS-CoV MTases (kindly provided by Dr Etienne Decroly, AFMB, Marseille, France), which were used as positive controls, transferred the radioactive methyl group from the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine to non-methylated or N7-methylated cap analogues (Fig. 5). Likewise, vaccinia virus capping enzyme, obtained from a commercial source and known to harbour N7-MTase activity, also demonstrated the expected activity. Based on these activities and the results of two negative control reactions (assays using BSA and no acceptor), we defined an incorporation threshold of 1000 c.p.m. to distinguish the enzyme activity in this assay. According to this definition, EAV nsp12 did not display activity with any of the methyl acceptors in the absence or presence of any of the potential ORF1a-encoded co-factors described above (nsp6\u20137, nsp6\u20137\u20138, nsp7\u03b1, nsp7\u03b2 and nsp7).

Unexpectedly, we also repeatedly observed the pseudo-reversion of Y32A to Y32V, which required only a single nucleotide change. Although valine is not amongst the naturally occurring amino acid residues at this position (Fig. 3), a hydrophobic residue is observed in several arteriviruses other than EAV. In addition to substitutions of these control residues, EAV also tolerated the substitution of S56 with alanine or threonine. Given the strict conservation of serine and threonine, this lack of impact was the expected outcome for S56T, but was rather surprising for S56A. Finally, S45A was stable and indistinguishable from the parental virus, whilst S45T reverted. Together with the sequence variation at this position, which is limited to the small amino acids glycine, alanine and serine, this probably indicates a certain degree of steric hindrance by any residue larger than serine. Overall, the observed mutant phenotypes were compatible with the natural variation observed at the respective positions, with the possible exception of the C84Y mutant.

We thus asked whether this so far uncharacterized subunit may represent an MTase, potentially able to perform both methylation reactions as, for example, the flavivirus NS5 MTase domain is (Zhou et al., 2007). Upon our bioinformatics analysis of nsp12 sequences, we found that this subunit, similar to the N7-MTase residing in coronavirus nsp14, is enriched with (partially) conserved aromatic amino acids and is predicted to fold in alternating \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, no statistically significant similarity was found between nsp12 and other MTases of viral or cellular origin.",

To explain this lack of activity, we argued that, as for coronavirus nsp16, a second EAV protein may be required to form a functional MTase complex. By analogy with the coronavirus nsp10 co-factor, we tested the possibility that this second protein might be encoded just upstream of the ORF1a/1b ribosomal frameshift site. We thus expressed and purified nsp7\u03b1 and nsp7\u03b2, as well as three polyprotein cleavage intermediates containing these two proteins, and included them in our assays (Fig. 5). However, in these extended assays we also could not detect any MTase activity. This could be for multiple reasons. (i) The proteins tested here may not be the correct co-factors or may be unable to properly associate with nsp12 under the conditions employed. (ii) More than one co-factor may be needed to spur nsp12's MTase activity or different RNA substrates containing specific sequences may be required. (iii) It may be that nsp12, which is smaller than other viral MTases, does not possess MTase activity, in which case other hypotheses about its function should be considered (see below).",

Reflecting the conservation of several aromatic residues in arteriviruses, substitution with alanine was not tolerated in any of the cases, whereas more conservative substitutions maintaining the residue's aromatic nature were tolerated in most of the partially conserved positions (Table 1). The only exception was F107Y, which interestingly showed a certain level of protein expression, but did not produce infectious progeny. As two arteriviruses distantly related to EAV, LDV and PRRSV genotype 1, naturally encode a tyrosine at this position (Fig. 3), this result suggests an epistatic interaction between residue 107 and other unknown residue(s). EAV also did not tolerate a block of nsp12 expression (STOP mutant) or the replacement of its single absolutely conserved nsp12 residue, F109, with alanine or tyrosine. This phenotype could be explained by a trans-dominant negative effect of these mutations on an interaction partner of nsp12, if this partner is essential for EAV replication. This explanation is also compatible with the non-viable phenotype of several other mutants and suggests a particularly important role of the most constrained and proximal F107 and F109 in such a putative interaction.",

In this context, a future in-depth analysis of the nsp12 interaction network could be most informative. If nsp12 is not an MTase, this activity must be provided by another protein, but it is unlikely to be one of the three other ORF1b proteins, which are known to possess non-MTase enzymatic activities. This implies that arteriviruses may be (very) different from other nidoviruses with respect to either the nature of the 5\u2032 end of their mRNAs and/or the mechanism generating it. We note that the presence of a 5\u2032-terminal cap-1 structure was reported for the SHFV genome (Sagripanti et al., 1986), but that monophosphates were claimed to present at the 5\u2032 end of LDV mRNAs (Chen et al., 1994), calling for additional studies to resolve the apparent conflict. Finally, the possibility of cap-snatching, the strategy employed by some families of negative-stranded RNA viruses (Fujimura & Esteban, 2011; Mir et al., 2008; Reich et al., 2014), may be explored for arteriviruses. This mechanism might accommodate the nsp11 NendoU as endoribonuclease and nsp12 as a cap-binding protein, which would connect coronavirus nsp16 and arterivirus nsp12 to a common target in an unorthodox way.",

Codon-based MSAs of virus genomes were produced using the Viralis platform (Gorbalenya et al., 2010), and assisted by hmmer 3.1 (Finn et al., 2011), Muscle 3.8.31 (Edgar, 2004) and clustal\nw 2.012 (Larkin et al., 2007).

To reveal the full extent of similarity between pairs of alignments, they were converted into HMM profiles, which were compared and visualized in a dot-plot fashion using a routine in HH-suite 2.0.15 (Remmert et al., 2012; S\u00f6ding, 2005). Distribution of similarity density in alignments was plotted using r package Bio3D (Grant et al., 2006) under the conservation assessment method similarity, substitution matrix Blosum62 (Henikoff & Henikoff, 1992) and a sliding window of 11 alignment columns.

The MSAs were converted into figures using ESPript (Robert & Gouet, 2014). Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees was performed using PhyML 3.0, with the WAG amino acid substitution matrix (Whelan & Goldman, 2001), allowing substitution rate heterogeneity amongst sites (four categories) and 1000 iterations of non-parametric bootstrapping (Guindon et al., 2010).

In all cases translationally silent marker mutations were introduced to allow discrimination between (partial) reversion of mutants after transfection and (possible) contamination with WT virus. Mutated gene fragments were introduced into full-length cDNA clone pEAV211 (van den Born et al., 2004), a pEAV030 derivative (van Dinten et al., 1997), using appropriate shuttle vectors and restriction enzymes. The presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing. pEAV211 DNA was in vitro transcribed and RNA was purified by LiCl precipitation. RNA was transfected into BHK-21 cells as described previously (Nedialkova et al., 2010). Transfected cells were monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy until 68 h p.t. using antibodies directed against EAV nsp3 and N protein as described previously (van der Meer et al., 1998). To monitor the production of viral progeny, plaque assays were performed with supernatants collected at 14 and 48 h p.t. or during the first 24 h p.i. to determine growth kinetics, as described previously (Nedialkova et al., 2010). To verify the presence of the introduced mutations or reversions in viable mutants, fresh BHK-21 cells were infected with supernatants harvested at time points at which transfected cells were positive in immunofluorescence microscopy. RNA was isolated after 18 h or when a cytopathic effect was detected. Finally, the nsp12-coding region was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using random hexameric primers in the RT step and EAV-specific primers for the PCR. PCR fragments were purified and sequenced.",
