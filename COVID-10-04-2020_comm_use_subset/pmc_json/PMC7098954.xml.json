Accumulating evidence indicates that multiple proinflammatory mediators are released from injured nerve fibers and adjacent immune cells after nerve injury and that these mediators in turn promote central sensitization and behavioral hyperalgesia (5, 10). Furthermore, animal studies have shown that peripheral nerve injury induces circulating immune cells to enter the spinal cord parenchyma, a phenomenon that may contribute to pain-related behaviors during the development of neuropathic pain (11\u201313).",

We also determined that CCI induced CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling, increased BSCB permeability, and promoted T cell migration into the spinal dorsal horn. Moreover, intrathecal administration of anti-CXCL10 antibodies attenuated the rats' behavioral hyperalgesia and reduced the CCI-induced increases in BSCB permeability and T cell infiltration into the dorsal horn.

Among the chemokines, CXCL10 has been identified as a potentially important trigger (39, 40), and our results provide further evidence for its importance. Previous studies have indicated that increased BSCB permeability is a prerequisite for immune cell infiltration of the spinal cord during the development of neuropathic pain (41), and we found that blocking CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling with anti-CXCL10 antibodies reduced the BSCB's permeability to NaFlu, which suggests that CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling plays a critical role in CCI-induced BSCB dysfunction.",

Past investigations have suggested that CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling contributes to the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain, although spinal CXCL9 and CXCL11 levels do not seem to have important roles in the development of chronic pain (42, 43). Other reports have shown that T cell infiltration of the dorsal horn may contribute to the onset of neuropathic and inflammatory hyperalgesia (10, 12, 39). Our present findings further this line of research by elucidating the potential mechanistic role of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in the development of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Our observation that blocking CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling reduced CCI-induced T cell migration into the spinal cord is consistent with past reports suggesting that CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling plays a role in the migration of T cells from the periphery into the CNS (44).",

Studies have shown that type 1 T helper cells secrete interferon gamma, and elevated spinal cord interferon gamma levels can induce CXCL10 secretion. CXCL10 in turn increases BSCB permeability and promotes the migration of T cells into the spinal cord (44, 49). This creates a positive feedback system that favors ever-increasing migration of activated T cells into the spinal cord. This implies that blocking the contribution of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling to increased BSCB permeability, as we did by administering anti-CXCL10 antibodies to the CCI group rats, may disrupt this positive feedback loop.",
