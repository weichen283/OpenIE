            "text": "Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae is an aerobic, Gram-negative, nitrogen-fixing bacterium that can live under the conditions of microaerobe, aerobe and form symbiotic relationships with Pisum sativum (pea) and Vicia cracca (vetch) under the condition of nitrogen limitation (Karunakaran et al., 2009). Organisms of this genus play a critical role in soil fertility, inducing the formation of symbiotic nodules on the roots of leguminous plants, where bacteroids reduce atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia available for plant uptake (Bhat et al., 2015). The symbiosis between rhizobia and legumes can be characterized by a mutual exchange of signal molecules between the two partners (Janczarek et al., 2015; L\u00f3pez-Baena et al., 2016). After attachment of the bacteria to the plant root, the plant supports bacterial infection via host-derived infection threads (Haney and Long, 2010). Successful nodulation requires the activation of cell division in the cortex to form the nodule primordium (Blanco et al., 2009). In nodules, the nitrogenase enzyme, which is extremely sensitive to oxygen, has a low turnover number and a large requirement of chemical energy in the form of ATP and reducing potential (Clarke et al., 2011; Okazaki et al., 2015). In addition to reducing N2 and protons, nitrogenase can also reduce several small, non-physiological substrates, including a wide array of carbon-containing compounds (Seefeldt et al., 2013). It was found that uptake hydrogenases allow rhizobia to recycle the hydrogen generated in the nitrogen fixation process within the legume nodule (Baginsky et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Oxidoreductases catalyze a large variety of specific reduction, oxidation, and oxyfunctionalization reactions, which are important in redox processes, transferring electrons from a reductant to an oxidant (Hollmann and Schmid, 2004; Jeelani et al., 2010). Oxidoreductases included laccases, GMC (glucose-methanol-choline) oxidoreductases, copper radical oxidases and catalases (Beckett et al., 2015). The family of GMC flavoprotein oxidoreductases, which includes glucose/alcohol oxidase and glucose/choline dehydrogenase from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, was first outlined by Cavener (1992). Members of the GMC oxidoreductase family share a common structural backbone of an adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate-binding \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2-fold close to their amino terminus (Iida et al., 2007). The group of GMC flavoprotein oxidoreductases encompasses glucose oxidase from the mold Aspergillus niger, the glucose dehydrogenase from Thermoplasma acidophilum and Drosophila melanogaster, methanol oxidase from yeast Hansenula polymorpha, and choline dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli (Ahmad et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013). In the leaf beetle subtribe Chrysomelina sensu stricto, GMC oxidoreductases enabled chemical defenses and were important for adaptive processes in plant\u2013insect interactions (Rahfeld et al., 2014). In E. coli, choline dehydrogenase catalyzes the flavin-dependent, two-step oxidation of choline to glycine betaine, which acts as an osmoprotectant compatible solute that accumulates when the cells are exposed to drastic environmental changes in osmolarity (Yilmaz and B\u00fclow, 2010). However, little is known about the functional diversity of the rhizobium GMC family.",

Since a large reduction in the nitrogen-fixing capacity of nodules inoculated with mutant strain was observed, qRT-PCR was used to assess whether the N-fixation system, e.g., nitrogenase genes, was affected in the transcription of ribosomal RNAs in the GmcA-deficient mutant. The expression of nifD and fdxB was analyzed in pea root nodules using qRT-PCR (Figure 4B). Unexpectedly, the expression level of nifD and fdxB was found to be significantly increased in 4-week-old nodules inoculated with gmcA mutant strain compared with control nodules. Thus, GmcA may function in redox balance and antioxidant defense system in the pea root nodules. hmuS gene expression was significantly down-regulated in gmcA mutant, both under H2O2-induced oxidative stress condition and in 4-week-old nodule, suggesting gmcA is involved in iron transport and regulation of iron homeostasis.",

This change in metabolism was mirrored by corresponding changes in proteins involved in the regulation of transcription, among which, a nif-specific transcriptional activator NifA and a nitrogen regulatory protein PtsN were highly expressed in the mutant bacteroids. The main groups of differentially expressed proteins identified were transport proteins, of which 6 were ABC-type nitrate/nitrite transporters.

Further analysis of the differentially expressed proteins identified a subset involved in stress response and virulence. The number of affected oxidoreductases, cytochrome oxidase, dehydrogenase, hydrolase, dehydrogenase, surface, and invasion associated proteins also suggests that GmcA function in antioxidant capacity in the root nodules and that the loss of these proteins could result in antioxidant defect.

The direct link between GmcA and H2O2 detoxification has been less reported, while in most wood-rotting fungi, the members of GMC oxidoreductase superfamily play a central role in the degradation process because they generate extracellular H2O2, acting as the ultimate oxidizer (Ferreira et al., 2015). Our results suggested that cells with GmcA tolerate internally generated or exogenously applied H2O2. Cellular oxidoreductases catalyze redox processes by transferring electrons from a reductant to oxidant and are important for protection against oxidative stress (Bisogno et al., 2010). The ferredoxin-like protein (FdxB) and iron transport protein HmuS are ubiquitous electron transfer proteins participating in the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and a wide variety of redox reactions (Chao et al., 2005; Gu et al., 2008). In Rhizobium, the peroxidases and the catalases KatG (catalase HPI), KatE (catalase), and OhrB (organic hydroperoxide resistance) were known to participate in the antioxidant defense mechanism against H2O2-induced stress (Vargas Mdel et al., 2003), and the two electron transfer proteins FdxB and HmuS are also involved in a wide variety of redox reactions (Chao et al., 2005; Gu et al., 2008). This cell cytotoxicity was relieved by inducing transcription of antioxidant genes (Jung and Kim, 2003). Expression levels of katG, fdxB, and hmuS genes were significantly down-regulated in the gmcA mutant under H2O2-induced oxidative stress. It has been reported that decreased ferredoxin-NADP(H) oxidoreductase (FNR) results in a more oxidized glutathione pool, while increasing FNR content results in a more reduced glutathione pool (Goss et al., 2012). Glutathione reductase activity in mutant RLgmcA was not different from that wild-type strain, but the absence of GmcA was associated with a 96.5% decrease in cellular glutathione peroxidase activity. Cellular peroxide deficit damages cellular macromolecules by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione peroxidases are one of the important ROS scavengers in the cell (Islam et al., 2015). The decrease of glutathione peroxidase activity is related to an uncontrolled increase of ROS (Giergiel et al., 2012).",

It has been reported that GMC oxidoreductases are involved in extracellular hydrogen peroxide and iron homeostasis (Rohr et al., 2013). Iron is required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation as a key component of multiple ferroproteins involved in this important biological process (Takanashi et al., 2013). hmuS was chosen based on previous studies, which showed that it was involved in iron transport (Chao et al., 2005). hmuS exhibited higher expression level in the mutant bacteroids, demonstrating the involvement of GMC in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Proteomic analysis of the mutant nodule bacteroids indicated that most of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in transporter activity, metabolism, and stress responses. These transporters may aid in regulation of ion and membrane potential homeostasis through their transport of nitrate, which is known to regulate the symbiosis (Vincill et al., 2005).

GmcA can likely play a role in nodule senescence, since senescent parameters such as increased activities of enzymes of amino acid metabolism, PHB production, and an increase in the number of disintegrated bacteroids occurred. In addition, glutathione peroxidase activity dramatically decreased, and amino acid metabolism reflecting arginase activity was increased. R. leguminosarum bv. viciae forms determinate nodules on pea and usually does not produce visible PHB granules during symbiosis. PHB granules occurred in undergoing senescence bacteroids, which indicated that the energy and carbon metabolism has shifted (Xie et al., 2011). The PHB and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles both start with acetyl-CoA. Under aerobic conditions, the TCA cycle is responsible for the complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA and formation of intermediates required for ATP production, but under oxygen limitation condition, when there is an inhibition of the TCA cycle by NADH or NADPH, the bacteroids favor PHB synthesis. During PHB synthesis, there is apparently a concomitant reduction in protein synthesis, a process coupled to ATP formation and utilization (Tal et al., 1990). In the symbiosis of the GmcA-deficiency mutant RLgmcA, the low expression of the catalase-peroxidase gene (katG), alpha/beta hydrolase (pRL80022), carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (pRL80023), succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (pRL120603), and alcohol dehydrogenase (pRL90027) inhibited NAD(P)H oxidase activity. To allow continued operation of the TCA cycle, NAD(P)H was channeled into other biosynthesis reactions, such as PHB synthesis, for acting as reducing equivalents (Xie et al., 2011).",

Moreover, the R. leguminosarum gmcA mutant was unable to compete efficiently in the rhizosphere with its wild-type parent, which shows that bacterial GmcA is important for adaptation to the microenvironment of the plant host. Overall, considering the poor nitrogen-fixing ability of its nodules, the mutant in gmcA gene had a profound influence on the whole nodulation process.",
