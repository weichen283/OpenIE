The susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered/removed (SIR) model are two widely considered models. The\ntheory of complex network can provide an analytic framework for heterogenous contact\npatterns of a population.6 The\nheterogeneous contact reflects the property that the node degree k, or, the\nnumber of contacts with other individuals for a given individual, is not uniform. The\nfrequently used network models are Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) random graphes,7 Strogatz-Watts (SW) small-world networks,8 and Barab\u00e1si-Albert (BA) scale-free\nnetworks.9 There is a sharp contrast in\ntheir degree distributions P(k). The study of epidemic\nspreading on complex networks shows the existence of a high correlation between the\ncondition of epidemic outbreak and the degree distribution.10\u201314",

In\nthis situation, whether to vaccinate or not is related to the risk of being infected by the\ninfectious disease.18,20 As a kind of\nindividual awareness,22,23 risk\nassessment of infection should be closely related to an individual's local information (the\nstate of an individual's neighborhood). Hence, individual vaccination behavior depends on\nits local information. For the convenience, we call such dynamic immunization as the\nresponsive immunization,21 which is also referred as the information-driven vaccination19 or the information dependent\nvaccination.24",
