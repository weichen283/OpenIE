Stark gaps exist between projected human health needs in a pandemic and the current capacity of public health, health care, and medical countermeasure systems. Finite production capacity and delayed vaccine development (ie, 4 months to produce the first doses of a novel pandemic strain vaccine and 6 months to generate a large supply) force the issue of who receives the initial doses [10,11]. What proportions of an antiviral stockpile to commit to treatment and prophylaxis, as well as who to prioritize constitute another dilemma [12]. Likewise, the projected number of US patients requiring an intensive care unit (ICU) bed and mechanical ventilation during a 1918-like pandemic eclipses current capacity by orders of magnitude [13]. In other contexts (eg, African countries with weak economies and endemic malaria and HIV/AIDS), a higher order predicament exists: whether to prioritize a response to a pandemic flu or to hyperendemic diseases [6,14].",

Nonetheless, over the last 15 years, members of the public have had some degree of opportunity to inform potentially divisive pandemic policies in the United States [19-40] (see Multimedia Appendix 1 for more details) and elsewhere [41-47]. Often convened by public health agencies, and occasionally by university researchers, private citizens and interested stakeholders have participated in dialogue and deliberation sessions about pandemic dilemmas in which ethical principles (eg, liberty, beneficence, fairness) and technical matters (eg, disease containment, medical treatment) are inextricably bound.",

Procedural ethics\u2014in particular, bringing affected groups to the table so that their needs and views on a shared health threat are genuinely heard, and they see a policy as having been made fairly even if they may not agree with the final decision\u2014are identified as a key means to respect cultural differences while advancing pandemic preparedness and response [14].",

New Zealand\u2019s ethics guidance asserts that given the disproportionate impact of past pandemics, it is essential to mobilize expertise within Maori communities on how best to address their own situation and needs [17]. Similarly, calls have been made for greater inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australian national, state, and territory pandemic plans so that the heightened risk of these indigenous groups can be mitigated in more culturally appropriate ways [49-51]. Planning experiences with Canada\u2019s First Nations communities and American Indian and Alaska Native communities have also evidenced the value of participatory processes in uncovering the influence of local beliefs, values, and practices upon pandemic health and in strengthening the cultural competence, social acceptance, and practical feasibility of pandemic preparedness and response efforts that affect these groups [52,53].",

The notion of a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d plan for ethically allocating scarce medical resources butts up against divergent sociocultural conditions [14,16]. The higher status accorded to elders within many African societies\u2014including those where the proportion of young children is higher than in other countries\u2014may moderate the importance of the young as a priority group [14]. Among Asian countries where honoring older adults, senior personnel, royalty, and public service staff is a strong norm, and where family ties accord strong obligations, privileged access along social hierarchies and familial lines to nationally stockpiled antivirals is not necessarily seen as unethical [14]. Contrasts made with an American ethos of individualism and wariness toward government include Canada\u2019s communitarian political culture emphasizing peace, order, and good government [54,55]; Australia\u2019s broad embrace of a utilitarian liberal rationale prioritizing others\u2019 safety over individual autonomy [48]; and the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cDunkirk spirit\u201d engendering solidarity and public cooperation with state emergency efforts [56]. Noted attitudinal differences between the US and UK populations about pandemic preparedness may also reflect different health care traditions and the greater influence of religious beliefs in the United States [54,56].",

It builds upon prior work by the authors exploring the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza [37-39]. Our initial aims were to develop, pilot, and apply a deliberative democratic procedure for conducting community forums state-wide that would inform a Maryland framework for the allocation of scarce health care resources in a disaster. An important finding was the need to convene a diverse, regionally varied sample of state residents to capture different ways of thinking about scarcity that local history and place seemed to influence [37,38]. Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team decided to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere. We wondered if the same core values continue to hold in other areas of the United States, whether variation in ethical frames of reference exists at the US regional level, and what practical implications of sameness and difference may follow for pandemic planners and policymakers.",

Third, at the discussion\u2019s end, each group developed 1-2 questions that they then asked to a panel of subject matter experts that included clinicians, ethicists, and disaster experts. Fourth, after this Q and A panel, and a break for lunch, moderated group discussions continued, this time focusing on the question: \u201cShould healthcare providers be allowed to take a ventilator away from one patient who needs it to survive and give it to another patient who also needs it to survive?\u201d",

Mexican Americans tend to view life-threatening illness as a problem for the entire family and health care decisions as a collective matter, in contrast to the privileging of autonomy in Anglo-American medical ethics [61]. These sentiments were particularly present among the groups convened in San Antonio, a city in which a majority of residents claim Mexican heritage; however, family was also a recurrent theme among the study\u2019s predominantly white participants from rural Colorado County. This is likely indicative of a cultural bias within the region where the family is a central institution [62,63].",

Residents of historically underserved Baltimore city neighborhoods worried about being passed over again; citizens of outlying, rural districts feared that city dwellers would get a disproportionate share of ventilators, just like state revenues. Cognizant of these concerns, state and local health authorities can communicate before, during, and after an emergency about ventilator allocation with greater empathy and in terms that are salient for specific communities.",

Foreseeing such an issue, the CDC\u2019s pandemic ethical guidelines advise striking the right balance between centralized decision making at the federal level and implementation at state and community levels where local situations and sensitivities can be better assessed and addressed [9]. Familismo has greater relevance in the southwestern United States than in northern, midwestern states where few Hispanics reside. In a state with many Mexican heritage residents and a wider regional and cultural emphasis on family, Texas health authorities may find themselves having to weigh family as a prioritization principle more heavily than peers in other US regions. Another public engagement exercise that oversampled for Spanish speakers found, for instance, that Hispanics prioritized children and pregnant women at much higher rates than non-Hispanics [31]. In addition, the varying religious compositions of US regions may shape the ethical principles that matter most to local communities in relation to allocation matters. Christianity, for instance, represents 59% of the religious composition of adults in New York City, in contrast to 77% in Texas [64].",

If a state like Texas develops a framework to standardize allocation decisions, then community-level health authorities and clinicians could localize how it is procedurally administered and conveyed to the wider community. This could help create a more culturally competent approach to scarce resource allocation. In respecting familismo, for instance, health facilities could adopt communication strategies that strengthen cross-cultural competency among critical care staff [65]. Moreover, health facilities could establish a process that gives family members a chance to confer among themselves when the patient no longer benefits from mechanical ventilation and withdrawal is called for. The emphasis within the familismo value system upon the collective and duty to the whole also provides a salient moral frame through which local authorities could communicate effectively about the need for developing and applying an allocation framework, and the importance of taking proactive measures that would help delay the implementation of an allocation framework in the first place, such as strengthening medical surge capacity.",

Due to financial constraints we were not able to employ random sampling. That small groups of participants may not capture broader community interests and views is a frequent critique of deliberative methods [66]. The sample may not represent the region\u2019s four cultural streams, but intragroup diversity (Table 1) and the Maryland contrast nonetheless facilitated a limited investigation of sameness and difference.
