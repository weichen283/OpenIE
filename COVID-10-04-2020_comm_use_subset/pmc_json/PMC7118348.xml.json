However, to give an idea, estimates range from 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4\u20130.5) [3] to 3.8% [4]. During an outbreak, the so-called naive CFR (nCFR), i.e. the ratio of reported deaths date to reported cases to date, will underestimate the true CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) is not known for all cases [5,6], assuming all cases are detected. We can estimate the true denominator for the CFR (i.e. the number of cases with known outcomes) by accounting for the delay from confirmation to death [6]. We assumed that the delay from confirmation to death followed the same distribution as the estimated time from hospitalisation to death, based on data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, between 17 December 2019 and 22 January 2020, accounting for underestimation in the data as a result of as-yet-unknown disease outcomes (Figure, panels A and B) [7]. As a sensitivity analysis, we also considered raw \u2018non-truncated\u2019 distributions, which do not account for censoring (i.e. because of the continued growth of the outbreak, cases with shorter incubation periods are more likely to be included in the data set); the raw and truncated distributions (Supplementary Figure S1) had a mean of 8.6 days and 13 days, respectively (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).",

Given that asymptomatic infections are typically not reported, especially during an ongoing outbreak of a novel infection, this correction is normally used to calculate the cCFR. However, because of the high level of testing on the cruise ship, we were able to use this correction to calculate the corrected IFR (cIFR). After that, we used the measured proportions of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases on the Diamond Princess to scale the cIFR to estimate the cCFR.

However, as the age distribution on the ship was skewed towards older individuals (mean age: 58 years), we also report age-stratified estimates. Using the age distribution of cases and deaths on the ship [1,2] to estimate for only individuals 70 years and older, the cIFR was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.6\u201313) and the cCFR was 13% (95% CI: 5.2\u201326) (Table 1).

This produced a total of 15.15 expected deaths, which corresponds to a nCFR estimate of 5% (15.15/301) for the Diamond Princess (Table 2), which falls within the top end of our 95% CI. As our cCFR for Diamond Princess was 2.6% (95% CI: 0.89\u20136.7), this suggests we need to multiply the nCFR estimates in China [7] by a factor 52% (95% CI: 14\u2013100) to obtain the correct value. As the raw overall nCFR reported in the data from China was 2.3% [10], this suggests the cCFR in China during that period was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.3\u20133.1) and the IFR was 0.6% (95% CI: 0.2\u20131.7). Based on cases and deaths reported in China up to 4 March 2020, the nCFR calculation was considerably higher than the cCFR we estimate here (based on data taken from [8], nCFR = 2,984/80,422 = 3.71% (95% CI: 3.58\u20133.84)). The confidence intervals calculated for China using an indirect standardisation method reflect the uncertainty in the Diamond Princess estimates, as it is carried forward in the scaling.",

It is challenging to accurately estimate the CFR in real time [5,11], especially for an infection with attributes similar to COVID-19, which has a delay of almost 2 weeks between confirmation and death, strong effects of age and comorbidities on mortality risk, and likely under-reporting of cases in many settings [10]. Using an age-stratified adjustment method, we accounted for changes in known outcomes over time. By applying this method to data from the Diamond Princess, we focused on a setting that was likely to have lower reporting error because large numbers were tested and the test had high sensitivity.

Although the Diamond Princess cohort was older, meaning that some deaths could be attributable to other causes, the natural death rate would have been much slower than the fatalities attributable to COVID-19. Given the limited background effect \u2013 and to ensure consistency with standard estimates of CFR rather than a hybrid \u2018burden over natural rate\u2019 calculation \u2013 we assumed that all deaths among COVID-19 cases were the result of COVID-19.",

Cruise ship passengers may have a different health status to the general population of their home countries, owing to health requirements to embark on a multi-week holiday, or differences related to socioeconomic status or comborbities. Deaths only occurred in individuals 70 years or older, so we were not able to generate age-specific cCFRs; the fatality risk may also have been influenced by differences in healthcare between countries. Because of likely age-specific differences in reporting, we focused on overall cCFR in China, rather than calculating age-specific cCFRs [10,11]. In doing so, we were assuming that there were no age-specific differences in under-reporting. The main source of potential bias in this assumption is the age-specific severity level of COVID-19; there may be far lower levels of detection in children if their symptoms are milder, meaning that they are tested less often.
