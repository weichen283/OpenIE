This was the case with SARS when governments persuaded on the severity of the virus bought large numbers of vaccines that were never used as its spread stopped without the need to vaccinate people.",

This was despite the change that was made on 13/02/2020 with regards to how confirmed cases are recorded to now include \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d instances as opposed to exclusively lab-confirmed. One crucial observation is that this more accurate forecast came with a significant decrease in the steepness of the slope compared to the forecast for the previous ten-days period. Another observation is that at the end of 20/02/2020, we were still over-forecasting the number of confirmed cases. Finally, all actual values lied well inside the prediction intervals range.",

The slope of the forecasts was, once again, lower compared to the previous two sets of forecasts, confirming the fact that the observed confirmed cases (up until 20/02/2020) show a steady decrease. We also observed a significant decrease in the associated forecast uncertainty, with the prediction intervals being much tighter compared to our past forecasts. The 90% prediction intervals worst-case scenario was about 600 thousand cases, which is halved compared to that of the last round of forecasts (1.2 million cases). The actual confirmed cases at the end of 01/03/2020 were 88 thousand. At the end of this third round of forecasts, we recorded an error of 5.5 thousand cases (6.2%). While this error was lower than the previous round (in both absolute and percentage terms), it was the first time that our 10-days ahead forecast were below the actual values (under-forecasting). This was because the virus had been spreading in three countries outside Mainland China (South Korea, Iran, and Italy).",

The absolute forecast error at the end of the last period (11/03/2020) was 15.4K (12.1%), higher compared to the previous set of forecasts but still well within the prediction intervals.

Second, we notice that despite the very small percentages of recovered cases until the end of January (less than 2%), currently, about 1 out of 2 confirmed cases have recovered (52.8% of the total confirmed cases).

The slowing down of the trend during this period suggested that COVID-19 would not cause any serious problems, particularly outside of Mainland China. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The last two sets of forecasts that cover the period 02/03/2020 to 21/03/2020 show a significant increase in the trend of cases globally coupled with an increase in the associated uncertainty. We hope that our forecasts will be a useful tool for governments and individuals towards making decisions and taking the appropriate actions to contain the spreading of the virus to the degree possible.",
