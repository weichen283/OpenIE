There are multiple causes for this vulnerability of patients with cancer related mainly to 3 factors: the underlying disease, cancer-directed treatment, and underlying comorbidities. The underlying malignancy may result in a weakened immune system due to the negative effect on immune cells, affecting their quantity or quality, as is the case in leukemia or lymphoma. Cancer therapy itself, whether it is surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, disturbs the immune system in various ways and results in an increased risk of infection. Patients with cancer are likely to have other comorbidities, whether due to age or exposure to cancer risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, and other lifestyle choices. Chronic diseases and comorbidities were identified previously as risk factors for MERS-CoV mortality.5,6 All these factors lead to the predisposition of patients with cancer to a high risk of acquiring infectious diseases with a worse outcome than patients without cancer.7",
